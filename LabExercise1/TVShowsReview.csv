"1","DiCaprioFan1"," One of the best sitcoms of all-time!","","29 September 2022","What can be said about Friends that hasn't already been said? It's easily one of the best sitcoms of all-time. It's on every ""best sitcoms ever"" list for a reason...because it is! If that doesn't convince you just read through these reviews and you'll see just how loved this show really is. The cast is perfect, not a weak link on the entire show. Almost everyone can find someone on the show that they identify with. I've seen every episode numerous times (considering it's always on) and I still laugh just as much on every watch as I did the first time I watched it. I'll continue to watch reruns and laugh and I doubt that I'll ever get bored with this show."
"2","Supermanfan-13"," Just as funny today!","10/10","16 May 2022","I still love Friends as much now than I did when it was on 15-20 years ago. It's just one of those all-time great sitcoms that are just as funny watching reruns as it was watching for the first time! Not many shows are just as funny today as they were 15-20 years ago but Friends is absolutely one of those shows! All 6 characters are almost equally as funny! This truly is one of the best comedies that has ever been made!"
"3","Silverzero"," Still as funny as it was when it started back in '94","","18 January 2003","People are saying that friends is running out of ideas and that the humour is getting dull. Running out of ideas? possibly. Humour getting feeble? absolutely not. In fact it's getting better. OK, so perhaps they're beginning to ""pair up"" the six of them, but so what. Chandler's sarcasm is still as funny as ever. Monica's quirkiness still works. Phoebe's goofiness still brings about a smile. And Joey,Rachel and Ross are still as funny as they always were. So stop being a bunch of cynics and enjoy the show while it's still on."
"4","jose990"," RIP Chandler","10/10","29 October 2023","I never used to watch this show. My wife loved this show and whenever she would watch it I would never pay attention because I had no interest in it. But then one day I happen to look up and see something funny and I got hooked. Out of all the characters on this show the one I can relate to the most was Chandler.I started watching all the reruns with my wife all the time on TBS. But after my wife passed away in September of last year I just can't bring myself to watch the show. All I have to say is the show is definitely worth watching and it was sad to see it go.Thank you Matthew for making me and my wife laugh. Rest in peace."
"5","rossrobinson"," fantastic","","12 November 2003","Friends has got to be one of the best Us Sitcom comedys ever. I'll be sad for this programme to end next year in 2004 because the whole team did such a fantastic effort to put everthing into this series. It was such a great programme and i think it will always will be. After 10 seasons the programme comes to it's end. I give this 10 out of 10."
"6","Mangalassery_Neelakandan"," FINE WINE","9/10","24 August 2022","The series aged like fine wine. I finished this whole series within a month like 236 episodes or more like 78 hours of content, that's how much interesting this series is. Some cliff hangers at the end of seasons is very suspenseful that i couldn't wait to watch the next season. Joey, Phoebe, Chandler, Monica, Ross & Rachel we like my friends by the end of the series. The comedic timing and all the funny elements of the show is on point. And the most important fact is that after finishing the series we could just start the series all over again and feel fresh. It has an immense amount of repeat value that we wouldn't get bored even after watching several times. I could go on for pages but the memes, the sitcom references, the stars the show created all speak form them selves."
"7","Moviebility"," Go-To show when you're sad","","18 October 2022","I won't lie when I say I'm probably one of the people who think this show is not funny. This has been recommended to me multiple times before I actually did give it a try. The first episode was meh but I kept watching until I found myself actually loving this show and it's really good and super chill. I think you actually have to know the characters more for you to appreciate their humor. This show is one of my go-to's when I'm feeling so down. Friends is so overrated and is always in most people's recommendations that you just keep on scrolling past through the list but seriously it's a good show and worth giving a shot!"
"8","Pookyiscute"," One of the best t.v. shows ever!","10/10","23 March 2004","Easily in my top five category of funniest and best shows in prime time history.Everyone on this show is so witty and delivers their lines superbly that it's hard not to like all of them equally.  However, I do have my favorite characters/actors/actresses, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.We'll start from least favorite to best character/actor.Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:Although some might say, because of his boyish good looks, his cute jokes that he delivers now and then (very well, mind you), and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time, he is a great actor, and plays his part as Joey Tribbiani really well, he's probably my least favorite on the show.  I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green: Rachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7.  Who is that, you ask?  Well, obviously Ross Gellar.  Her roommate Monica's brother.  Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine.  Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more.  But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.Courtney Cox/Monica Gellar:It's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy.  But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.Lisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey: Now, I love Lisa Kudrow.  She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show.  She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.David Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:It's so funny to me that I like him so much.  He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show.  He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines.  He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:They should have a shrine dedicated to this man.  He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on!  He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented.  I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance.  If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.So, with that I give this show a definite 10/10.  It's one of the best shows to come out within the last ten years, and definitely on my top five best shows of all time list.And that's my review."
"9","RahulM007"," The One that started it all!!!!!!!!","","25 October 2019","I started watching Friends this year and found it hilarious and amazingly written. The writing of the show is flawless. It truly is the funniest comedy I have ever seen. Each character is unique in its own way. The levity in the show is not what you would expect.Joey is the funniest character and his quirks and funny one liners never get old. He taught me to always have a humorous mind set in life and to not worry about what other people think if I do not understand something. Joey is in many ways the womanizer of the group and does not care too much what other people think and perceive of him. It is strange seeing him on the Joey show without Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica and Phoebe. He was a much better and funnier character on Friends. To be candid, I am not surprised that the Joey show got cancelled after two seasons.Ross is a character who got funnier over the course of the series. Introduced as a guy who got divorced by his lesbian wife, Ross built up quite a reputation. His relationship with Rachel had its ups and downs, but I always knew they were meant to be together. The writers and producers even teased their relationship in the series premiere. Ross's funniest line of the entire series is undoubtedly ""We were on a break"".Chandler is a character who changed and evolved the most. He was introduced as a guy who made sarcastic jokes about literally everything and never wanted to settle down with someone. He underwent a massive change in his life in the sixth season of the show. Season 6 was a major status quo shift for him.Rachel is a character who was introduced as this spoiled rich girl and slowly became successful and independent. She taught me that it is never too late to grow up and to never give up.Phoebe taught me to seize the day and savor every moment of life. Introduced as a person who never wanted to settle down with someone, that changed dramatically when she met Mike.Monica is a character who developed as a character and really found herself in season 5 when she started dating Chandler. I never expected Chandler and Monica to end up together. The phrase ""opposites attract"" is particularly true for them. Monica taught me to have an open mind and be bold.In a nutshell, Friends has something for everyone. It sheds a light on a variety of issues that are topical today. It is the funniest comedy I have ever seen. It is better than Two and a half men and The Big Bang Theory combined. Every episode is hilarious and makes you happy. For me, it does not decrease in quality nor are there terrible episodes. To be candid, no show can surpass Friends for its hilarity."
"10","dee-regan"," Goodnight Chandler Bing","9/10","29 October 2023","I must've have rewatched these 10 series dozens of times since it first aired.After hearing the devastating news this morning that Matthew Perry had passed away, I'm watching it with a new pair of slightly sadder eyes.'Friends' got me through a sad and difficult childhood. Sitting down to watch the new episodes at 9pm every Friday on channel 4, was one of the only things I can remember my family did together with no arguments.First watched as a 12 year old, not getting most of the jokes, but laughing (mostly at Chandler!) all the way through each episode ....and now watching as a 40 year old, understanding far too well all the troubles of love and work, and life and friendship.What a brilliant show."
"11","midz"," My Friends on T.V.","","12 August 1998","There never has been a sitcom that truly pictures life among the  singles (twenty-something) as good as this show does. It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes  in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too.  The humor is universal.  I feel like I'm part of the group every time I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through. Plus, of course, it is so much fun because it's fast-paced.  Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you don't feel like it is dragging you onto nothing.  Just like how a sitcom should be. Funny!"
"12","Fabrizio03"," The Best Show Ever","10/10","20 February 2005","Everyone says that Seinfield is the greatest show ever. I love Seinfield but it doesn't come close to Friends. Every episode of Friends will make you laugh non-stop. We have grown to love the characters and what happens to them. The fitting personalities of these characters are absolute genius. Rachel the spoiled yet sweet girl, Monica the mother figure, Phoebe the hippy chick, Joey the dopey yet cool Italian, Chandler the sarcastic loser and Ross the neurotic victim stay together to help each other with their problems in the big city. I've got every season on DVD. This sitcom, in my opinion, is the greatest sitcom of all time and it changed the TV world forever. It's a great show."
"13","yaxleycratler"," They'll be there for you!!!","","6 August 2018","Friends is without a doubt the best American TV show ever to air. It has sad and hilarious storylines and makes you feel the sadness and jot out of any situation. The actors do fantastic and you really feel like you know a part of them by the end of the show. This will be a show I will never forget as I make constant references to the episodes. I wish the show could come back on air because I miss them so much, but I'm glad it got all the fame it did because it deserved it."
"14","manojmagecha"," A timeless and endless classic","10/10","25 March 2020","I cannot remember the amount of times I've sat down and thought ""I want to watch a new series on Netflix and start a new film!"" And after 5 minutes of watching something new I thought, why bother?!? And switch over to watching friends 😂 easy to watch, great comedy and full of content that's completely original. The more I watch it the more I learn about the characters I grew up with, and how I would respond to certain situations, with or without the overhead laughter in the background. I don't know a single person that hasn't seen this, so if your one of them reading my review, do yourself a favour and grab a glass of wine, or whatever, and prepare for back to back television greatness.
Thank you ""Friends"""
"15","alizafatyma"," MAKES ME FEEL HAPPY AND CALM","","27 September 2022","Okay, so i watched friends 3 4 years ago and now it has become a daily part of my life. Im engineering student so i often come home exhausted from uni and watch friends with my sister all day to relax . I love the show the characters make me laugh and i forget my worries. A lot of people have complaints about the show saying it doesnt having enough POC characters and being unfunny? As POC i literally have no problem with the show's lack of POC characters honestly, i mean it doesnt bother me that much and i agree Seinfeld has better jokes than friends but it doesnt mean that friends isnt funny, its different and simple and flawed and that what makes the show so good to watch. A lot of people watch friends to learn english too so its fun. Not everything has to be ""woke"" and a masterpiece for people to enjoy and cherish and please do not forget the show came out in 90s and back then creators didnt focus that much about different agendas."
"16","ramtrishan"," G.R.E.A.T.","10/10","12 September 2019","Even in 2019 it is very funny. A really great show.
Must watch"
"17","embless"," Just finished watching whole series on Netflix","","13 August 2018","I am such a fan of the Friends tv show. The characters are well developed independently and together they play off each other well. Some moments are cheesy while others are funny, while the rest is just very well acted and dialogued by the cast. 
At least give the first season episodes a go, if you still don't like it, don't watch it. But for those who enjoy a well developed multi character show..... Friends is sure to make you laugh and want to get to know each character more. 
Its a television show.... there are bound to be goofs or inconsistencies, no television show has ever ever in the history of tv been 200% perfect. 
I plan on buying the whole series on Blue-Ray soon to add to my dvds."
"18","imdb_girl90"," Watched in 2020 for the first time!","10/10","29 March 2020","I turned 30 this year and I watched this series for the first time! Yah that's true.
I started watching from mid Jan 2020 and completed today the 29th March 2020.
All I can say to the cast and team of F.R.I.E.N.D.S is THANK YOU!
Thank you for making this gem.
Thank you for giving me 6 new amazing friends.
Thank you for giving me such a wonderful family for life.
Thank you for showing that being a single mom, being a mom via adoption, being a surrogate mom is all wonderful and normal.
Thank you for making me understand that I must do what I love and love what I do.
Thank you for making me understand that with all the traits of mine, if I'm also kind and beautiful from the inside, then am wonderful, am loved, am accepted, AM ENOUGH.
Am sad that the series is over and I now understand why so many people are asking for a reunion. Well! Here's another person added to that list.Team! Thank you once again. You all are loved. FOREVER!"
"19","TheLittleSongbird"," One of the better American sit-coms","","24 May 2010","I have nothing against sit-coms in general, as long as they are funny. In America, there is Frasier and Will & Grace, in Britain, there is Only Fools and Horses and Last of the Summer Wine, they are great sit-coms. There was a time when I didn't like Friends very much, then again it was also at a time when I wasn't into sit-coms. My brother and sister, who absolutely adore the show suggested I should try the show again, so I did. Well, my initial reaction of the show was wrong, this show is great, it is funny and smart with appealing characters. It is by far one of the better American sit-coms and I do think it is better than Everybody Loves Raymond.First and foremost, I love the theme song. It may get on some people's nerves, but I find it irresistibly catchy, memorable and fun, with a simple melody and nice lyrics that are relevant.I also love how funny and smart Friends is. Some of the episode titles alone are hilarious and clever. That reminds me when I see and review When Harry Met Sally, maybe the title of the review should be ""The One With the Scene in the Diner"". Along with this the writing is consistently funny, with some wit and intelligence and very rarely becomes clichéd and cringe worthy. I even like the plot lines, I don't find them boring, predictable perhaps occasionally but the funny situations that the characters get into make them absorbing and worthwhile.The direction is also really solid, and the photography and scenery are striking.I love the characters, they are unique and engaging, even with their flaws they manage to be likable. Rachel does have moments when she is spoilt, but she is also the epitome of sweetness. I know there are people who have problems with Jennifer Aniston, the thing is I don't and I find her at her prettiest and most appealing here. Monica is another strong character, not the funniest by all means, but because she is almost like a maternal figure to the other characters with her caring and sympathetic attitude. I loved how Courtney Cox portrayed her. Phoebe is my favourite female character, she is hilarious; I especially love her songs, they are the sort of songs that are so bad they are great. Lisa Kudrow couldn't have been the more perfect choice for her, she pulls off Phoebe's personality to perfection.Joey is stupid admittedly, but I love him anyway because he is also cool. I am not a huge fan of Matt LeBlanc, but he is really good as Joey. Matthew Perry is great as Chandler, who is like a clownish and sarcastic sort of character, who makes jokes that are almost as bad as Phoebe's songs, but he is still a likable character in his own right. Ross is deliciously neurotic, I constantly love his priceless facial expressions and David Schwimmer's delivery is absolutely perfect.There have also been some wonderful guest stars, Elliot Gould as Jack Geller, Gary Oldman(who I really like in films like Dracula and Immortal Beloved) as Richard Crosby, Michael McKean and Danny DeVito as a stripper who arrives at a party in a policeman's outfit, all but to name a few. Overall, I love this show, not only for the writing but for the characters. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

I never had expected that nothing but a series of which I had no idea about would me some very good memories
I loved this one a lot
Rachel Monica Phoebe Ross Chandler and my favorite Joey I love them all
I have no long long words or some monologues to describe their impact on me and many others like me
and by the way I completed this one in almost 14 days between (4March - 18 March)
Oops!! Addiction I hear it!!!"

"23","AlsExGal"," Probably the last and the longest of the great network sitcoms","","2 October 2010","Suffice it to say that Friends is a classic comic treatment of what I have always called the ""post-college adolescent phase"" of life, which is roughly the ten years immediately following college graduation as you strike out on your own and try to find your place in life. It is the time in life when you are likely to have the best health, the most freedom, the most disposable income if not necessarily the most total income, and the most fun if you are fortunate enough to have people to share it all with. This phase ends when you ""settle down"" both career-wise and family-wise, and I always found Friends to track this time in life quite accurately and with both drama and great humor.It follows the life of six young people living in New York City from 1994 to 2004, so even now a few of the cultural references will be stale, but the relationship truths never will be. Ross is the nerdy guy who grew up to be a little uncomfortable in his skin but still very good looking. Ross' sister Monica is an aspiring chef who is now thin but was obese up until the middle of high school. Rachel has been Monica's friend since high school and is adjusting to life without daddy's credit card when the series begins, and is looking for a career in fashion. Chandler, Ross' friend since college, is successful in his budding career in business. Rounding out the group is Joey, not the brightest bulb in the room, who wants to be an actor and as a result works a series of odd jobs and stars in a series of odder commercials and the occasional appearance on a TV show. Finally there is Phoebe. Her history with the group doesn't go much past the beginning of the series as she's had a rather Bohemian upbringing that has led to a Bohemian adulthood. Complicating factor as the series begins - Ross' wife has just declared she is gay and left him for another woman, Ross now and always has had a crush on Rachel who doesn't know he's alive, and Ross' wife discovers she is pregnant by Ross shortly after the separation.One of the best shows on TV with the most heart and the most laughs. Highly recommended."
"24","johnascough-61241"," Perfect","10/10","8 June 2020","Perfection. An incredibly well crafted show, everything from writing, acting, set, it is all unbelievable. A must watch but I warn u, u will become obsessed with the show."
"25","renaldo and clara"," no other show comes close","","6 October 2000","I try........not too hard, but I try.........to watch other sitcoms and actually try to ""hee-hee"" and understand the humor, but I can't! Will & Grace, and their annoying ""who's your daddy cr@p"", Two-Men-And Whatever-And-A-Pizza-Place, ohmigod... give me a friggin' break!It's not just that there is so much chemistry between the ""Friends"" cast that the TV could explode, though this is true. Actually, maybe that's the main reason it is as good as it is. What I mean: Although it is a show full of inside jokes that you understand a lot better if you've seen every episode before the one you're watching, it isn't *essential* to have seen any episodes before to start liking it and being hooked instantly. That's how it happened to me.I didn't start watching until season 4!! But once I did, I thought Rachel Green, Jen Aniston's char, was the coolest, and the cutest character. Now, it's more generic. I especially adore Joey and Chandler of course, and I also like the other three. Each character, except unfortunately for Monica, has grown positively in their own way.On a sidenote, I really do hope that the ""anchor"" quality Monica's character used to have can come back a bit in season 7.  Especially as Chandler's fiance/ now, it would be a terrible thing to waste her character on just simple humor they exposed her character to in the last few seasons.Being a Friends fanatic, allthesame, I wouldn't want this awesome show (especially) to have even the *slightest* chance of wearing out its welcome. As it is, the cast agreed to sign for 2 more seasons(this one and an 8th), and I really hope it can keep up the quality it's always had in these to come. Although I adore Friends, I don't see any reason why they would want to tire a sitcom after these seasons are over. Especially since all 6 are extremely talented actors in their own right.-----***WATCH FRIENDS EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT, ONLY ON -- NBC -- !!!**----------Could I *be* any more emphatic?  =)"

One Piece was shown on Cartoon Network when I was 13/14 & I thought it was lame. Now, I see why it was lame, it was 4kids English version which was pretty horrible.Monkey. D. Luffy is the captain of a small group of pirates, famous as the Straw Hat Pirates. He recruits a small and diverse group of people who will be his nakama on the journey. He is more interested in food and nakamas than in gold & money as normal pirate would be. He is a comedian more than a captain, but he rises to the occasion when needed and he's a good role model. He wants to get to One Piece & become the King Of Pirates. He gets Roronoa Zoro on board first. He is a highly skilled swordsman & is known as the pirate hunter Zoro. He uses three katanas & its his ambition to become the best swordsman in the world. Then Nami comes aboard as the skilled navigator. Its her dream to draw the map of the whole world. After that, Usopp the storyteller (i.e he's a great liar) becomes their nakama.Next Sanji becomes their cook. His dream is to prove that All-Blue exists and he's an awesome kicker along with being a highly skilled cook. But, he loses it whenever he sees a beautiful lady. Then comes Chopper, a reindeer (you heard me right!). He becomes their doctor and he's very good at it. Then Nico Robin hops on aboard. Her dream is to find out about the ultimate Poneglyph, Rio Poneglyph. She has a power and a troubled past.This story is about taking the initiative to go for your dreams. Take the awesome adventures with Luffy and his nakama and you'll fall in love with them. There is comedy, spirit, love and an awe-inspiring factor in the anime. Even the animation which feels weird at first grows on you so much that you'll like this kind of animation more than the others.Now, I have just finished seeing the Sky Island episodes where Enel is fighting Luffy (200th episode). I have to say I am hooked to this show. This is definitely a show not for meant for kids. Even if you hate hearing the Japanese language, try seeing it for some episodes and you'll get hooked. I can't recommend this series enough. See it, believe it, enjoy it. This is my all time favourite anime, above Bleach & Naruto. This is miles above those anime. Anyone who has seen all three anime will agree with me!10/10"

Luffy will sure to succeed his goal in becoming the Greatest Pirate that ever lived.Comic made back in the late 90s, and the anime series has been around since the earlier days of SpongeBob. I first heard of it when it came on the FoxBox back in late 2004. I wasn't entirely into many anime back then. And I never saw the English Dub of the series, as I found it to be an OK series. After reading on the internet that the dub is heavily edited and nothing like the original. I grew interest on how good it is. I read the first volume of the Manga series. And liked how the story was going.Wasn't until January 2007, when I finally start to check out the Anime. Only I viewed the episodes that are subtitled, uncut, and uncensored. And I grew to love it. The animation is very well done, it's funny, it's action packed, and it's dramatic sometimes. I don't even consider it a kid's cartoon, when it's more aimed to teenagers. But with an interesting cast of characters, and over a hundred secondary/miscellaneous characters. One Piece is indeed a great Anime next to Case Closed, Naurto, & other ongoing series.The reason why it's very underrated was because of 4Kids being the first company to distribute the anime. Which they edited and censored a lot. And many flaws in the dubbing. Such as voices that don't suit the characters' personalities. Too many pirate accents and catch-phrases that get old instantly. All the violence, blood, alchol, drugs, and nudity were altered and removed. All the weapons were altered to look harmless. 4Kids spent more time edditting than spending time on the scripts. Plus a lot of filler and small episodes were removed. And most of them were too important to take out in the series. The good thing is 4kids no longer owns rights to One Piece. I knew they would drop it, because they did a poor job in introducing the series to English speaking countries.With over 300 episodes, I can tell that One Piece is really big in Japan. I've seen all the current episodes. And can't get enough of it.So those who like their Anime uncut, should highly recommend seeing One Piece uncut by fan subs or Funimation's release on the series."
"41","Doliko"," This is what an anime fan should call home.","","4 September 2013","Looking at the IMDb reviews it seemed rather strange to me that most of them (the top ones at least) were quite outdated, written in 2005-2006 actually or the reviewers had not seen more than 50 or 100 episodes. Having said that please note that i have seen 610 episodes and 2 movies(strong world, film z) as of the day I'm writing this review. I hope my review will provide you with valuable insight to the series or even convince you to watch it. I will try to be as spoiler free as possible.It's been about a year since i started watching anime regularly and that is something I have yet to regret. I mostly enjoy short anime with less than 50 episodes that have good plot and well made characters, anime like cowboy bebop(my favorite), mushishi, ergo proxy, code geass etc. I knew about anime like OP, Naruto, Bleach even before I started watching anime but kept avoiding them even when I had seen about 50 (I must have seen over 100 now XD) other anime mainly because I thought to myself 'how can they be any good when they have that many episodes? Aren't they out of ideas yet?'. Well I might be right about Naruto and Bleach but when it comes to One Piece I couldn't be more wrong. One piece is so good, so enjoyable and it never ends which is something everyone who is watching it wants.Talk about long introduction huh? Anyways onto the actual review now. It will be divided into 4 sectors: story, characters, art and sound, enjoyment.STORY: Now the story at first might seem very simple and straightforward, a young boy Monkey D. Luffy (17 years old)setting out on sea on a great journey to become the Pirate King and find One Piece the biggest and greatest treasure in the OP world that was left in 'that' place by the former Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. Before Roger was executed publicly by the marines-world government he told everyone that if they wanted OP they had to look for it and that it was all left in 'that' place and that ignited the great age of pirates. The series is divided into arcs, each featuring its very own story and setting, each island, each place the straw hat pirates (Luffy and his crew) visit is a whole different adventure with new people to meet and new circumstances. And that's one of the best things of OP, you never get bored. You are fascinated by the huge and diverse OP world and you just can't let go of it. Everything is interesting and everything is fun, Luffy and his crew never chose the easy path but they strive for adventure and excitement and they almost pass their feelings to us the viewers. That's something very rare especially in anime and OP handles that expertly. Once you have seen enough episodes you will realize that the main characters of the series, especially Luffy, don't really care about their destination, hell most of the times they don't even know where they are going at all. All that matters is that they are going somewhere interesting where they will learn new things, get stronger, meet new people and face powerful foes. Another thing worth mentioning is that the series has very few fillers (episodes that did not exist in the original story-source material-manga) unlike some other mainstream anime series(Naruto, Bleach anyone?). Also the fillers are actually not that bad, sure they are not good but many of them are OK. And that's a huge plus for an anime series.CHARACTERS: This is where OP really shines. Each character is presented with great detail, they are all quite unique. Everyone has their own backstory explained thoroughly and we get to see why they are who they are, why each one of them has their very own ambitions and dreams. Due to their different experiences they have very different personalities and through good character development we see how they interact with each other and how they get closer to each other. We see how they become comrades and everyone is looking for each other, they become something very close to a family. That's the kind of bonds they make. Furthermore we not only see the history and personality of the straw hats but many others too like members of the marines. We see why they make the kind of choices they make. Nobody is entirely evil and nobody is purely good. Everyone has a good reason behind what they are doing and they strongly believe in their own cause, in their own justice and in their own dreams.ART AND SOUND: One Piece also excels in this sector with beautiful and vivid animation. The sceneries look alive and all different from each other with their very own characteristics. The characters are illustrated masterfully and each character looks a lot different from each other (that's a huge plus in anime). The sound department also did a great job especially with the voice actors, I'm always talking about the original Japanese (don't you dare see the English dub),who fit really well into their respective characters. The music, for me at least, is very catchy and actually really well made. However that depends on personal taste, if you are not really into this kind of karaoke-Japanese style of music you might not like it. Nevertheless OP really has some of the greatest music themes I have heard in an anime.OVERALL ENJOYMENT: One Piece is one of the most, if not the most enjoyable and diverse anime series you can find. It really excels in pretty much every field there is. It is the only anime series, or any series, I have seen with that many episodes and yet manages to stay that good(and believe me, have I seen a lot). I recommend OP to anyone with enough time and hunger for adventure. If you have not decided whether to watch it or not just watch 10 episodes and see for yourself if you want continue or not (oh you will want to continue). Trust me and you won't regret it, just like I did.And yep that's the end of it fellas. If you enjoyed my review and found it useful please upvote so others can see it.2021 update: I've been on the fence about deleting this since it's so poorly written, I was 17 at the time of writing and not a native speaker, and my opinion on one piece and anime in general has changed dramatically for the worse. But I figured I might as well leave it be since people seem to like it and it serves as a kind of snapshot of my 17 year old self whose input other hopeful 16 and 17 year adventurers out there might find helpful."
"42","derbling"," incredible epic ride","10/10","6 July 2005","It is difficult to sum up the story of a series with hundreds of episodes, TV specials and movies, so I'd rather just try to tell you what it is about and why it is so incredibly good.The series starts off with a guy named Luffy whose ultimate goal it is to become the one and only ""King of all Pirates"" and to find the greatest treasure in the world. The first episodes introduce him and some characters and make a lovely start that is entertaining and makes one want more. On his way Luffy meets a lot of very interesting characters who become his crew members and friends - each of them with an intense and captivating background story. Every character in this series - be it friend or foe - is either adorable, tragic, despicable or interesting at the least... no boring characters anywhere. Later on in the series, important events and story twists are often visualized or supported by huge appearances in the fabulous and unreal environments that our crew travels. This is perfectly done and helps the already epic feel of the story. I have seen 150 episodes, four movies and two specials so far and there were moments that made me cry, laugh, think and re-watch some episodes (especially 85-90) at least 30 times. You might come to the false conclusion of having a kids show here due to the presentation, but that is definitely wrong. People sometimes say about a movie or series that it is ""not a life changer, but entertaining"". That is definitely not the case here! I know it sounds nerdy, but this series has broadened my horizon in many ways and I recommend anyone to take the admittedly long time to get into this epic adventure. The best way to do so will be to watch the fan-subs which are as close to the original as a non Japanese will get (explanations of puns and traditions). There are of course some filler episodes in a huge project like this which won't blow you away, but that is only natural with hundreds of episodes and helps developing the characters. This show is an easy 10/10"
"43","andrewfantasy1213"," Brilliant anime! Fantastic story","","17 January 2021","One Piece is the best selling manga of all time for a reason! Oda is a genius created over a thousand characters and many of them are so memorable with amazing world building and brilliant art. Kaizoku ou ore wa naru!"
"44","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187"," One of Shonen Jump's premiere franchises.","10/10","24 October 2020","One Piece has become something of a colossal cult-phenomenon around the world, though it's a household name in Japan thanks to Toei Animation's seemingly undying commitment to Shonen Jump adaptations, such as Dragon Ball, Dr. Slump, Saint Seiya and Slam Dunk.At over 900 episodes this show has become probably the longest running digitally-painted anime in history: thanks to Toei's transition to digital cel-animation in the late 1990s. This show's got great characters, a fun world and the action gets just enough punch to not be too boring or derivative of Toei's other Shonen-derived shows.This is an anime household name and anyone into Japanese animation should give this one a shot. P.S. You DON'T need to have seen all of this show's episodes because... y'know: it's ridiculous catch-up time in one sitting."
"45","simonximenes"," Words cannot describe it....","","27 January 2010","I don't know what to say...I'm totally in love with One Piece. Years ago, my friend once told me that the top three best anime in the world were Bleach, Naruto and One Piece. Since I have watched Bleach and Naruto, I totally agreed that Bleach and Naruto were the best. But One Piece??? I was very doubtful at that time. Why? Because there's no way an anime that is childishly drawn could be at the same level as Bleach and Naruto. But my friend keep persuading me to watch One Piece and one fateful day, I tried to watch it continuously for one whole day. Oh my God!!! I was completely stunt! This anime is beyond my expectation. What an epic. For me, it was better than Bleach and Naruto. Luffy and the Strawhat Crews have their own unique characters that can be related to most of us in our daily life. The supporting characters and villains also have characteristics that will stuck in you mind for ages. I think that's why One Piece is the best. Most of us 'feel' for each of the characters in many ways...may it be in laughter, agony, suffering and so much more. Kudos to the One Piece's production team especially the amazing creator, Eiichiro Oda; for creating a world that is beyond ordinary but still can amuse ordinary people like me and you.A must see anime before you die..."
"46","Tifa128"," If you believe in your nakama, anything goes!","9/10","29 September 2006","On first glance, One Piece is not too different from other Anime series. It has hilarious, roll on the floor from laughing humor and so much action it makes you wonder if the crew ever gets tired.But in its core, One Piece is about something else: it's about nakama. Nakama, a Japanese term generally referring to comrades, receives a completely new feeling in One Piece. Stand by your nakama, believe in them no matter what happens, no matter what anyone does or says about them. Help them in any situation, even if it means putting your own life on the line. With you nakama, you can do anything. And it is this extreme sense of comradry that makes you fall in love with the characters and wish you could be a part of the strange little group.It also teaches how humans are allowed to have flaws; in fact, all people do: seemingly perfect Swordsman and first mate Roronoa Zoro has no sense of direction whatsoever and can easily get himself lost on any one way street, navigator Nami is absolutely crazy for money, cook Sanji loses his mind once he sees a lady.. and the list goes on and on. But despite these flaws, they continue fighting. For each other and with each other. If one crewmember can't do it, somebody else will be right there for support. If you're looking for a funny, action-filled series whose main characters easily grow to your heart and feel like family: go for One Piece. You will not regret it!"
"47","IonicBadger"," Watch the Japanese dub if you can","","28 December 2007","Well after watching this show for quite a while i noticed one thing. The English dub is horrible and all the scenes of the so called violence are cut out. I actually watched the first five episodes again in Japanese after seeing the English dub and it so much better. Apparently this show has been cut extensively to suit it for all ages witch does not do this show justice i think its quite friendly to children. Take my word for it watch one episode of One Piece on English. And then watch the Japanese version you will see the difference. This show is great and deserve so much more."
"48","Catman_Scrothers"," It's not an anime, it's an experience.","10/10","14 August 2020","I've followed this series for going on 15 years and it never fails to amaze me. From the characters to the world building, the details are everything here. Until almost 500 episodes in, I honestly forgot about the One Piece, because there is so much more going on. The emotional impact of each saga, and the naturally feel good vibe of this series can probably cure depression (I know it cured mine).At first glance, I like many others, skipped over this series because of the animation and overall goofiness that seemed to engulf it. I couldn't have made a bigger mistake. Don't be fooled, just like the real world, this world shows a coloful fun facade, but there is a much darker reality that lies underneath. The world is a very cruel and unfair place, but that can't deter you from achieving your dream and exploring all it has to offer.The main protagonist Monkey D. Luffy, embodies the human spirit as much as any character in fiction, and just like his rubber ability, he always bends but never breaks. His fiery passion and indomitable spirit to become ""King of the Pirates"" inspires those around him, and his fun loving, free spirited personality and compassion for his crew make him an excellent leader.The crew itself are full of different personalities and I almost guarantee that you'll relate to at least one of them. Each bringing their own strengths to the crew. As a fan of the original Dragon Ball, I loved the teamwork aspect and sadly, it's something that didn't carry over as well to DBZ, but was somewhat redeemed in Super. By which I mean, there was a point where Goku and Vegeta vastly surpassed everyone else. Whereas in One Piece, Luffy is the Goku of this series, but no one survives in this world alone and strength comes in all different forms, not just raw power. The strongest crew will find the One Piece, not the strongest person.Eiichiro Oda and his team have been producing chapter after chapter almost every week for over 22 years. The love and detail he puts into everything is noteworthy, and the anime should receive recognition for the voice acting and excellent score, despite how some people feel about the animation and pacing. It's still better than most.Whether you decide to read the manga, watch the anime or both, take your time and enjoy one of the greatest adventure series ever made."

"50","Venom5970"," The Greatest Story Ever Told.","10/10","6 December 2021","(Review for both the anime and the manga, December 5, 2021, currently with 1034 chapters and 1001 episodes).Wealth, Fame, Power...Those were the words that started the greatest story of all time. Words that still hold massive amount of meaning in the story today. Words that will hold even more meaning when the story is ultimately brought to an end.We see how wealth, fame and power can impact the people of this world. That these things cannot bring happiness, and in many cases will just bring the complete opposite. Look at the Celestial Dragons. The most wealthy, powerful and quite famous individuals in the world. They view themselves as better than everyone else, that they can do whatever they want, even if it's incredibly inhumane. But in the eyes of the people that live beneath them, they are monsters. Monsters who are slaves to the wealth, fame and power they posses, and monsters who enslave. People who are not free, and take away freedom.Freedom.This is one of the core, if not the main element present throughout the entire series. Because, those three words ushered at the beginning of this story do not hold meaning in a persons life if that person is not free, and is willing to help others be free. They hold no power without freedom, because ultimately, the people like the Celestial Dragons, are not powerful people. They cannot sway the masses through the use of words and gain the trust of a random person on the street. They are feared. And does being feared make one powerful? Maybe. But people do not like to recognize it.The protagonist in this story, Monkey D. Luffy, wants to become the Pirate King, the freest man in the world. He wants to share that freedom, and is willing to with absolutely anyone. Even someone who may have attempted to kill him mere minutes ago. He is the pure embodiment of freedom, not giving a care in the world and just having fun.Another core element of the series is friendship. The crew of pirates you grow to love, are the best of friends. They will do whatever they need to do in order to keep each other safe, to keep the freedom they work so hard to gain. But challenge to take away that freedom, and you'll be sure you're not gonna get away easy.There is so much more I could say about One Piece. About the great characters, unmatched worldbuilding, and one of the greatest mysteries in any form of media ever. But that could go on forever. One Piece is not perfect, no story is. It has it's flaws. Sometimes humor doesn't land, maybe a fight scene isn't great, a character is just annoying, or even entire arcs that just drag and are sometime almost boring to sit through. But, there is just something special about One Piece that no series has ever been able to re-create, and I think will ever be able to create. It is truly something you should watch or read in your lifetime, and some of the values and beliefs can make you leave a better person. It did that for me. 10/10.Below are my ratings for each arc of the series below, if you are at all interested.Romance Dawn - 8/10

"51","maxyg18"," Great anime series","","13 April 2007","A pirate named Luffy wants to become the pirate king, but besides that, he is on a quest to go to the Grand Line and organise his own pirate to search for the treasure that that has sent people sailing to the seas, called 'One Piece'.ONE PIECE is an absolutely fantastic and fun anime. Also every episode in the series cannot be missed, since each episode has something to do with the storyline which make the show more and more addictive, unlike some other TV shows. There are even times where it can actually even make you care for the characters, which also make the show surprisingly moving.IMPORTANT: Beware of the English dub because it's been Americanised and politically-corrected to make it a kids show. It's been distributed by 4Kids. So in other words, ONLY watch the Japanese version otherwise the American version will turn you off."
"52","rohitgurrala"," One piece a perfect anime","10/10","25 May 2021","One piece is a anime which shows friendship, action, feelings, adventure etc. It is the best anime show I've watched and I don't regret the 5 months I watched it."
"53","renegadeviking-271-528568"," one piece","","9 December 2015","There are two responses I get, without fail, every time I try to get someone new to watch this show. ""I don't like the art style,"" or ""I've seen the dub - NO THANKS."" I'm guilty of both of these myself. But if there's one thing I need to stress before even getting started on this review, it's that the 4Kids dub is NOT One Piece. For the love of god, PLEASE do not think it is. If you've suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the 4Kids episodes, just erase them from your mind and start fresh. They butchered it, there's really no other way to put it. They cut episodes, changed the dialogue to fit a MUCH younger and apparently far less intelligent audience (almost insultingly so), gave the characters RIDICULOUS voices, and pretty much watered down the entire series. FUNimation has done a much better job so far from what I've seen, but regardless, watching it in its original Japanese form with subtitles is really the way to go.As for the art style, it's true, it's completely different from almost anything else I've seen. Much more ""cartoonish"" and maybe not what you'd expect from an anime. Despite that, you end up loving it. I wouldn't even say that you have to ""get used to it"" because it's not something that detracts from the rest of the series in any way. It didn't even take me two episodes before I was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything I'd experienced before. Now, some 300+ episodes later, I can't remember ever NOT liking it, or even why I would have. Especially now with One Piece being aired in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful - VERY sharp and wonderful to look at.Now that we've got those two points out of the way...One Piece is actually one of the best shows I've ever seen, anime or otherwise. The plot is pretty basic at first. Monkey D. Luffy has just set out on his own to find the legendary treasure 'one piece' and become Pirate King, and he's looking for a crew to sail with him. You'll find yourself falling in love with each and every new member as Luffy finds them. They're all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities. They form one very quirky crew that's always discovering new adventures and somehow getting themselves into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams. Each main story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and they're just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the Straw Hat crew. Not one character is left out or feels like they're there for no reason. Everyone has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about One Piece is that these 'purposes' often resurface at later points in the series. No detail is left untouched, and you'll seriously be amazed by the way Oda threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the series progresses.The plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like I said, quickly evolves into something HUGE. Much of the beginning of the series is dedicated to forming the crew and letting you get to know the characters, though it's definitely never lacking in action, but once they reach the Grand Line, you're swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic story arcs you'll ever watch. The battles and fights are well-paced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely EPIC. But even through the action, One Piece never quite loses it's lighthearted, humorous edge. The episodes are sprinkled with PLENTY of funny moments, never too many and never too few. There's always a wonderful balance of action and humor.One Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise! There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things. I've definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point. One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments. And underneath everything, there's always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA.In a word, One Piece is perfect. And perhaps I'm just biased, being an obviously OBSESSED fan at this point, haha, but what can I say? It's been running for 344 episodes so far and not ONCE have I wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end. It is, simply put, amazing."

All the characters are well developed and Oda make sures every character gets justified. Unlike any other long running series Anime and TV alike. If you let episode count to not watching it you are missing one hell of an adventure. Compare it to American TV shows where popularity and ratings defines the story a.k.a character assassination, rather than the author's original intent. You will find this much more appealing. P. S. I don't want to criticize American shows, infact I watch a lot of them. But hate it when the creators decide to make a character important just for the sake of it that makes me irritated."

I don't know what I am going to say about this arc. It's the best arc for now. War is amazing. All of the characters are perfect. The Luffy's Haki is perfect. Just perfect but Ace died in the Great War. That's one of the saddest moments in One Piece.Post-War
We saw Luffy's back-story and we see Sabo's dying. Shanks and Marco pay their last respects to Ace and Whitebeard. All of the crew starts 2 year training.Fish-Man IslandReturn to Sabaody
Crew gets together in Sabaody Island. They changed. We see The Fake Straw Hats. I hate them so much.Fish-Man Island
Again most of the people don't like this arc but I really love that arc. All of the fights and storyline is very good but maybe one thing is bad. The Villains. I don't like them. It could be better.DressrosaPunk Hazard
It's really good. We saw Smoker, Trafalgar D. Water Law. The Fights are amazing. Especially Law. Luffy's new techniques are really good. The animation is perfect. I really love that anime.Dressrosa
This arc just perfect. Luffy's Gear 4, Zoro vs Pica, Usopp Observation Haki, The Story Line, Bartalomeo, and Fujitora. Fujitora is a great guy. I loved him. The back stories are perfect. We learn that Sabo is alive and he is got Ace devil fruit. Just perfect. End of the arc The Straw Hat Grand Fleet is formed and the crew got new bounties.Four EmperorsZou
Zou arc is good. We learned something bad about Sanji and Luffy decided to take him back so he is going the Whole Cake Island but some of the crew go to Wano.Whole Cake Island
This arc is perfect. I can't handle it anymore. There is too much awesomeness. The Fights, Sanji's back-story, Luffy's fate in Sanji, Katakuri vs Luffy. That's a perfect arc. Most importantly The MVP of this arc is Brook. He did so much important thing in this arc. End of the arc Luffy and Sanji got new bounties and Luffy become The Fifth Emperor.Levely
We saw a lot of important thing in this arc. Imu Sama, The Big Straw Hat and something happened to Sabo but we don't know it right now and we learn that The Warlord System is removed.Wano Country
Wano. A masterpiece. The animation is perfect. The fights, Oden back-story, The reunion The Straw Hats, Wano's beauty, All of it perfect. This arc is my second favorite arc. It's still ongoing but the end of it I'm sure that is is going to be a number one.That's it. If you're not watching One Piece, you're missing a lot. It's a Masterpiece. Don't scared the numbers of episodes. You will not regret and most of the people say it will be better after 300th episode or 400th episode but they wrong it is perfect from the start. You must watch it right now.Thanks for reading."

"60","unkommon"," Tentative Review (Wano Country Arc)","10/10","6 May 2021","I'm writing this possibly midway through the Wano Country Arc, the manga is still in Act 3 (of a potential? 5) and who knows how much is ~really~ left of One Piece. We could be looking at as few as 3 years or as many as 10. One thing is for certain, even though the ride isn't over, the ride so far has been absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best journeys fiction has ever offered. Eiichiro Oda is a literary genius.For being a manga and an anime that have taken no more than a few weeks breaks at a time, the quality to the quantity is beyond immaculate. From (basically) start to finish there has not been a dip in the quality of story-telling. One could say some of the best arcs took place earlier in the series, but that certainly doesn't discount just how fantastic some of the more recent arcs are. Even the (often contentious) Fishman Island Arc is leagues above some of the outstanding arcs of other popular manga/anime.Without diving too deep or giving too much away, one of the standalone factors that makes One Piece so beyond stellar is how impressively funny and brutally painful it can be, all within a couple pages or minutes. The fact that it is one of the funniest series in no way undermines the great depths of drama One Piece reaches. Are there funnier manga/anime? Are there sadder and more harrowing manga/anime? Yes and yes, but the fact that One Piece is such a master class in both comedy and drama only exacerbates just how freakishly human One Piece truly is. It captures beautifully the highs and lows of the human condition in such a way that seems impossible for a series with Devil Fruit abilities, haki, fishmen, sky people, giants, and singing skeletons.Beyond that, the thing that truly sets One Piece apart (and a term all too ubiquitous with the series) is its world building. The world of One Piece is MASSIVE, and that's not just describing the actual planet where the story takes place, but the lore, the characters, the relationships between characters so seemingly disparate the thread could only have been finessed by someone with a mind like Oda, a mind, mind you, that is no stranger to making obscure callbacks to details so minuscule hundred and hundreds of chapters ago that even the most devout fans can miss. One Piece is by and large one of the single most expansive fictional lores helmed by a single author (and illustrator!) For a little bit of context, the Lord of the Rings including The Hobbit is roughly 1,550 pages while One Piece is somewhere around 20,000 pages of illustration, and while a manga panel may not say exactly one thousand words, it's beyond commendable that one person could pen 20,000 pages of anything for one singular story. A singular story that encompasses so many characters, and insights, and backgrounds, and history, and minute details, that millions of people from virtually every country have come to see this tale and journey as something of a second world, a place they can escape to and join this magnificent captain and his ragtag crew as they journey to the end of the world.One Piece is truly something beyond magical, and when it eventually ends it will exist in the echelon of the greatest stories ever told. It could end right now and still make it into that category, but as any fan can tell you, the best is still yet to come. So, until then, this tentative review will have to do."
"61","conradcarlo_venzon-1"," Anime Of The Century... This Is Simply The Best!","","3 February 2008","The Anime ""One Piece"" takes place in a world where pirates rule the seas, Devil Fruits are scattered all over the world, and the most prized possession of Gol D. Roger is the target... One Piece!Gol D. Roger was the Pirate King who had fame, fortune, power, everything that anyone wanted to have... On the day of his execution, he revealed the location of his treasure, One Piece. He said that it is hidden somewhere in ""The Grand Line"".This made people set sail and try to obtain the treasure of treasures, One Piece. Sadly, many have failed and died trying to obtain it. But over the years, it has drawn attention to hundreds of Pirate groups who seek the title of Pirate King. The whole world has entered the Golden Era of Pirates. The Era where almost every pirate's dream is to become The Pirate King. They formed formidable crews to overcome those who are also seeking the treasure of treasures.This is where the story starts. The protagonist of the tale is a boy who had set his eyes on becoming the new Pirate King. The Boy's name is Monkey D. Luffy. He's the son of the most wanted man named Monkey D. Dragon and the grandson of Vice-Admiral Monkey D. Garp.Heads up, Portgas D. Ace is not Luffy's Brother. Ace is the son of the Pirate King and his real name was Gol D. Ace. He took his mom's surname Portgas, instead of Gol.On the island of East Blue, Luffy grew up in hoping to be a pirate someday. He befriends with a pirate named Captain Shanks. He looks up to Shanks as a hero and would do anything to be part of his crew. But he was too young at that time to become a part of the crew.One day Luffy accidentally ate the Devil's Fruit, Gomu Gomu (Rubber) that Shanks has at his possession. It gave Luffy the ability to become a human rubber. But once a person eats the Devil's Fruit, they'll be cursed with the powers forever and you'll lose the ability to move when they fall into the sea. Now Luffy is cursed to be a human rubber forever but vowed that even if he is cursed, he'd use this to his advantage to get the title of ""Pirate King"".As Shanks departs with his crew, he gave Luffy his most prized possession, his straw hat. He told him to keep it with him, until they meet again.A few years later, Luffy starts his quest to find some friends for his pirate crew. Throughout the series, he'll find new lands, new allies, treasures, dangers, and plenty of villains to face. On his journey to find new nakamas(friends), he met Roronoa Zoro the swordsman, Nami the navigator and thief, Usopp the Liar, Sanji the cook, Chopper the team's doctor, Franky the shipwright and Brook the musician.Their adventures can be unbelievably funny and other times, they're incredibly sad. There are only two animes that I cried on. This one and the other is Naruto. I can't hold my tears because this anime got into me.. Most of the background story of the characters are really really sad.This anime left me speechless the first time i saw it and it still leaves me speechless now.. And I still can't get enough of it. It even inspired me to create my own manga... The title is ""My Twelve Wings"" Hopefully, in the near future, it'll get published... hehe hopefully... I just started this morning but I already have an ending...Eiichiro Oda! You're my #1 favorite manga artist and thanks to you, the world of One Piece is made...Someday, I'll tell my future children and grandchildren the story of the almighty Monkey D. Luffy and his crew!I'll cherish this anime till the day I die"
"62","dollybear-07164"," Great Storyline","10/10","30 May 2021","The story was kind of childish and slow at first but I liked all the adventures! It also had a lot of comedy in the beginning, especially at Sky Island and Thriller Bark. But then I like how many mysteries there are later in the story. What is the Will of D, and why are there people with ""D"" in their name? Is it connected to the Poneglyphs or the ancient weapons? What is the Void Century and what happened during that time? Did Gol D Roger learn about it? I want the show to end to see the conclusion but I also don't want it to end at the same time. I hope no one in the crew dies later on, because Ace's death was sad, and he was just a side character, with little screen time and not even part of the crew. Even the Merry's death was sad and she's not even a living thing! I hope to see how this story progresses in the future!"

"85","wisewebwoman"," An annual DVD event for me.","","7 December 2004","Watching this is a celebration of how Jane Austen should be interpreted.This version is true to the novel and true to the characters and the wonderful tension between Elizabeth and Darcy is beautifully depicted.Not for a moment do you think that these two are not meant to be together.The Austen wit of both the main characters and the minor roles are strongly projected and the costumes and sets are faithful to the era of Austen's writing.There is an incredible scene where Elizabeth is playing the piano and her eyes meet and hold on Darcy's who is at the other end of the room. Now, for me, that is one of the most sexy and sensual scenes I have ever seen. Everything is flawless about this production.Superlative, satisfying and stunning.Do not miss it. 10 out of 10."
"86","Wulfstan10"," Hard to Beat","10/10","7 March 2005","This version of Pride and Prejudice is simply outstanding and excels in essentially every aspect. It is faithful to the book, particularly capturing the spirit of the book and the energy and constant tension of the story. It excellently portrays the world of the book as it relates to the story, with keen attention to the details of costume, the furniture, etc. Moreover, the actors were on the whole outstanding. I fail to see how anyone could have portray Darcy better than did Colin Firth, who perfectly captured the character's aristocratic refinedness, his shyness and sense of decorum that come across as apparent stuffiness and disdain, and his underlying passion, all at the same time. He perfectly blends all these different traits and is utterly convincing in portraying the outward stiffness as a simple facade for the strong emotions and character underneath, rather than simply being stiff and wooden. His looks, and especially his eyes, say so much of the complexity of his character and his feelings with subtle expressions. Similarly Jennifer Ehle excellently portrays Lizzie, showing her to be tender, witty, thoughtful, occasionally prone to strong judgments without all the information, yet trying to grapple with different feelings as her involvement with Darcy, et al., progresses. David Bamber is great as Mr. Collins and perfectly conveys his mix of traits. Alison Steadman's histrionics and fickle opinions are wonderful as the mom, and remind me very much of an actual relative of mine, while Benjamin Whitrow is a great counterpart as the father who is outwardly usually calm and peaceful, yet always able to rile up his wife. The others are great, too, but there is no point in listing them all. The bottom line is that I find it hard to beat this production, which is utterly gripping and keeps anyone interested in these stories completely entranced the whole way through."
"87","Rosabel"," Perfect book, perfect film","","9 July 1999","A female journalist once wrote that no actress could ever portray Elizabeth Bennet to the satisfaction of a woman viewer for one very simple reason: every woman really visualizes herself in that role.  Jennifer Ehle has done the impossible - she is, and in my mind, forever will be, Elizabeth.  The beauty, wit, and sparkling liveliness of the character are perfectly captured in her performance.  And Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy is an exact match for her.  His smoldering good looks are wonderful, and he can portray reserve without descending into woodenness and blankness.  The scene where he and Elizabeth dance a long and stately dance together in the midst of a crowd is both controlled and exciting - with very little change of tone, and while preserving the most correct decorum, their conversation reveals dangerous undercurrents of emotion, and meanwhile the steps of the dance keep pulling them together and apart again. The rest of the characters are equally fine - David Bamber's obsequious Mr. Collins is especially unforgettable."
"88","pekinman"," A great adaptation of Jane Austen","10/10","8 August 2009","This version of 'Pride and Prejudice ' is one of the greatest adaptations of any classic book that has yet been filmed. This is due in large part to the masterful screenplay written by Andrew Davies. He has managed to lace together all the pertinent dialogue scattered about the chapters into cogent conversations without resorting to anachronistic modernisms. This allows the film to flow seamlessly and in a very satisfying manner. A great cast of actors has been given a fine script and they all turn in great performances. I wondered at the wild, over-sexed behavior of the youngest Bennet daughter, Lydia, here acted by Julia Sawalha. She is allowed to display her wide-ranging, formidable comedic talents. I especially loved the little snort she emits in an early scene, displaying that she is truly her mother's favorite daughter and very much like her. Mrs Bennet, played hilariously by Alison Steadman, is a vulgar, loud and ostentatious woman and I liked her very much in this part.Mr Bennet, the long-suffering patron of this family is played with laconic humor by Benjamin Whitrow, a piece of perfect casting. Jennifer Ehle is splendid as Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine who gets her man in the end, as they always do in Austen's novels. I won't belabor the countless nuances of her characterization other than to say that she is deeply satisfying at every level. Her elder sister, Jane, is played by Susannah Harker ('House of Cards') with a sweetness that stops just short of simpering.The middle daughter, Mary, is an early prototype for the first suffragettes. Lucy Briers had quite a challenge to make anything of Mary who is often relegated to the background. But Briers sets the tone for one of the most hilarious scenes in any film I've ever seen; the dinner party at the Netherfields Ball where she entertains the guests by singing and playing atrociously. Note Anna Chancellor (Miss Bingley) in this scene. I burst out in loud guffaws at her reactions.Anna Chancellor was an inspired piece of casting for Miss Caroline Bingley the aristocratic and condescending sister of Jane Bennet's beloved. Miss Bingley is an interesting character. The Prejudice against her is immediate, on the part of Elizabeth, as Miss Bingley is aloof and fork-tongued. But she is really a good person who tells the truth. It's just that she is a product of her highly sheltered and sophisticated environment and ""comes off"" snooty and vindictive. Colin Firth is ideal as Mr Darcy the romantic interest of Elizabeth Bennet's life. Tall, handsome, well set-up, intelligent and gentle, Firth's portrayal possesses all the traits of a high-born gentleman. He is NOT a snob but he is aloof and easily bored. Not unusual in a very intelligent person. However, Elizabeth's Prejudice, out of ignorance of Darcy's life, seems a worse misdemeanor than his Pride which seems like arrogance but isn't.David Bamber ('Heavy Weather') portrays the obsequious Reverend Collins with oily unctuousness. Collins is funny, yes, but also maddening in his obtuse inability to comprehend the feelings and thoughts of anyone besides himself. Only his new wife, Charlotte Lucas, comprehends his nature and finds happiness in her life with him. Charlotte is one of those characters, along with Jane Bennet and Mrs Gardiner, who occupy points of equilibrium and sensibility to their environments. When any of these 3 women are holding forth one senses serenity in the atmosphere that stops the whirling dizziness of most of the characters' states-of-mind.Barbara Leigh-Hunt turns in a masterful performance as the monstrous bitch Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Such spite and malice as Lady Catherine possesses is spat out with acidic nastiness. Her first scene when she meets Elizabeth is also extremely funny.There is a minor masterful performance from Harriet Eastcott, who plays nursemaid-companion to Lady de Bourgh's sickly daughter. Without uttering a word Ms Eascott conveys volumes as to the put upon, subservient and terrified situation of Mrs Jenkinson.One of the great delights of this mini-series is how it takes its time to actually observe this long-dead society. The ball scenes are gorgeously executed. The choreography of those intricate and beautiful dances is hypnotizing. There are long periods where the camera watches these dancers, moves about among them. It is beautiful to behold. The actors must have been sorely challenged to deliver their lines in such a natural manner and yet having to time them to fit the complicated steps they have to perform.All the technical aspects of this film are superb, especially the editing. The forte-piano playing of Melvyn Tan glues the entirety together. Simon Langton's direction is so good as to be invisible. I cannot praise this version of 'Pride and Prejudice' enough. It is one of the two great Jane Austen adaptations on film, along with Roger Michell's wonderful version of 'Persuasion' with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds."
"89","Qanqor"," Perfection","","8 March 2011","This is the most pointless review I've ever written here, since there are already tons of reviews, tons of praising reviews, and everything that I might want to say has already been said. So nobody is going to find my review, nobody is going to read it, nobody is going to find it useful. It is for this reason that I've put off writing this for so long.But I watched this series again last week, and I just love it so much-- to the point of reverence-- that I've elevated it into the top echelon of my very favorite movies. For many years now I've been saying I have three favorite movies (North By Northwest, The Music Man, and Airplane), but henceforth I have four favorites. And so I'm finally writing a review, mostly because it bugs me that I wrote reviews for lessor versions of P&P but not this one.This one is the standard by which all others should be judged. Scene after scene, character after character, line after line, it is just perfect. Or so close to it that I'm not going to quibble.But everyone has already gone over its many merits, and there's no point in me repeating those praises. Still, one thing which deserves special comment is the music. The main theme is really, really good; a solid melody, some superb chord changes, and well scored. I've had it stuck in my head now for over a week now. And it's skillfully and effectively worked throughout the production in various variations, if one pays attention.Finally, I have to give strong praise for the extremely minor character of Mary. This is the rare production that really gets Mary right: insufferably moralizing and disdainful (and actually homely, rather than typical Hollywood stick-an-ugly-pair-of-glasses-on-her homely). Poor Mary. She really gets the short end of the stick in the Bennet home. Jane and especially Lizzy are beloved by their father; Kitty and especially Lydia are the mother's favorites. But really, nobody cares very much for Mary. And, not being pretty, the young men officers are indifferent as well. And so, finding little pleasure in the world, she shuns pleasure right back, and retreats into her sermons and books. It always seems like a defense mechanism rather than a true passion. This is the only production I can recall that really brings forth that aspect of the character.Look at this. For a review I wasn't even going to write, I've rambled on far too long. In any case, if you *haven't* seen this production of Pride and Prejudice, do so at once!Also (and perhaps most importantly): It was seeing this series that eventually got me to go back and actually read the *book*. And oh was I delighted I did! If you've never read the original Jane Austen book of Pride and Prejudice, do so at once!"
"90","ROCKY-19"," It's about time!","10/10","22 December 1998","After so many years of seeing adaptations of Pride and Prejudice on stage, screen and television, I had long given up hope of an entertaining and faithful adaptation. Then a miracle!  Class, style, humor and intelligence is alive and well! Direction, script and cinematography are all exceptional in A&E's production. Imagine watching a six-hour program over and over and over. It has to be done. Jennifer Ehle gives Elisabeth all the archness, tenderness, and homey wit that Austen could desire. Each individual cast member gives a memorable performance that makes the character real. Simon Langton, as director, has a real ear for dialogue and silence. Indeed, it is often the silences in conversation that are the most hilarious. The most serious fault in most previous productions was the casting of Darcy. A stiff actor in a stiff part gives you only a stiff character (even, God bless him, Olivier). If Darcy fails, the entire production is a waste. The inspired casting of Colin Firth in this production was defining. Putting Firth, a naturally lively chap, in the role was like harnessing energy. You can often feel that intensity of containment, which is just perfect for Darcy. This is a must-see for any loyal Austen reader or anyone else who likes romance, wit and social commentary all rolled into one. And pity Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, which opened in the U.S. shortly after Pride and Prejudice debuted. Comparisons were inevitable and did not favor S&S."
"91","SimonJack"," Excellent series of Austen classic not likely to be bettered","","17 April 2014","Of the several versions of ""Pride and Prejudice"" I have seen, this 1995 BBC mini-series is by far the best. First, it gives us more of the story than any other version, with 5 ½ hours of film time. The 1980 minis- series was more than an hour shorter; the 1940 film was under two hours; and the 2005 film was barely two hours. Second, it develops all the characters more fully, including the lesser supporting roles. Third, its script additions to the story seem to fit best Jane Austen's style and plot, so they enrich the story where otherwise we would have holes. Austen said she didn't know the manners and behavior of men when they were not in the company of women. So she didn't write scenes or situations with just men in them. Writer Andrew Davies wrote some excellent filler for this film. The opening with Darcy and Bingley riding their horses across fields to see Bingley's new country home is a great introduction. Toward the end, we have another perfect scenario. Darcy rides to Pemberley a day ahead of his entourage. He stops to cool off with a swim in his lake, and then bumps into Elizabeth as he walks up to his house in dripping wet clothes. It is a more human way for the couple to meet to rekindle their relationship. Here, on his home territory, he loses his shyness and begins to warm up. Everything about this film excels. But the script and acting raise it above all other versions. Those who see P&P simply as a romance or love story will be satisfied with the shorter movies. For sure, it is a beautiful story of love, especially two loves. But those loves are ensconced in a critique of society and the times. Austen deals with social mores, the class system of the time, families, marriage and morality, manners and respect, and vice and virtue. And, it's how she works all this together that gives depth to the story. This film gives us the greatest satisfaction with how the love stories turn out.Most – but not all – of the characters in this version are the best portrayals among all the P&P films made. Most viewers admire Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth for their roles. But some others are equally good, and I think a couple are very exceptional performances. For sure, Ehle is superb as Elizabeth. With her constant smile and eyes she shows restraint in her silence at times, and wonderful wit in her barbs at other times. Firth, better than anyone else in the role, shows Darcy's frustration at times over his social shyness. His consternation is very noticeable at not being able to break the ice with Elizabeth as his attraction for her grows.Lydia and Kitty have much more screen time here with their childishness. It gives us a better sense of how Mr. Bennett felt as the father of the silliest girls anywhere. Mr. Bennett is best played here by Benjamin Whitrow, although Moray Watson was very good as well in the 1980 mini- series. Whitrow shows the right amount of disdain, affection, hurt and withdrawal. It's clear why Lizzie likes him, because of his clear-headedness, but she also rues that he has lost respect for his wife. Crispin Bonham-Carter seems best fit for the part of Mr. Bingley, both in physical appearance and in his persona. The Bingley sisters don't stand out in one particular film. But Anna Chancellor has more time to develop her character here, and gives a biting portrayal of the caustic Miss Bingley. All of the roles of Jane have been very good; but a nod goes to Susannah Harker in this 1995 film. She is more naturally shy in her humility and goodness. The character of Wickham is played well in all versions; but again, Adrian Lukis really shines in this one. We see the uncertainty in his face as he learns from Lizzie that her views of Mr. Darcy are changing. Charlotte Lucas is played best here by Lucy Scott. She seems more natural, yet uncomfortable with her appearance. She is adroit in her observations and in the knowing exchanges she has with Lizzie. The only role I didn't think was very good or right was that of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Barbara Leigh-Hunt seems way too old to have a young teenage daughter. Judy Parfitt nailed that role in the 1980 mini-series. I saved for last the two roles I think excel the most – even above those of Elizabeth and Darcy. No one in any other version comes close to the outstanding performance Alison Steadman gives here as Mrs. Bennet. She put such exuberance and flighty vitality into the role of the silly, nearly hysterical housewife, that it was hard not to dislike her. We can empathize with Mr. Bennet and understand how he came to lose respect for her. Steadman brings her consummate acting abilities to the part and engages viewers to feel real embarrassment for her. That is great acting. And, that's what Elizabeth begins to see toward the end. Finally, Mr. Collins. David Bamber's interpretation is likely the most difficult of any Austen role to play. Did Jane Austen write or envision him as such a wimpish and puerile person? Clearly, she wrote some criticism, if not sarcasm, for the church of the time in its relationships with the classes. Bamber's portrayal of Collins helps focus on that issue. This film gives a much better view and treatment of this character than any other film. So much went into the making of this series, and it is nearly perfect in all aspects. It's hard to imagine that any attempt will even be made to try to better this version of ""Pride and Prejudice."" It is the classic film rendition of a great classic novel."
"92","keng5"," Doing justice to Jane Austen.","10/10","23 May 2005","This is a drama to rave about. I've not seen its like on television before; nor do I expect to see its like again. It was superb. It was almost perfect - though not quite.It is rare to find a Jane Austen dramatisation that comes so near to being perfect on every level and that stays so true to the original novel. The greater part of the dialogue in the series is Jane Austen's own and every scene is included and follows the same chronological order. The drama departs from the novel in only two instances. In order to extend our knowledge of the characters of Darcy(Colin Firth), and Mr Collins(David Bamber), two scenes are added; to demonstrate that Darcy is not just an effete aristocrat but a real man worthy of Elizabeth's love we are shown him indulging in manly pursuits; fencing, and swimming in his private lake (it puzzles me why so many women seem to drool over his wet-shirt scene); and to demonstrate that Mr Collins is an idiotic, narrow- minded prude we are shown him trembling with embarrassment and horror when he happens to come across Lydia (Julia Sawalha) in a state of dishabille. David Bamber makes Mr Collins deliciously toadying and obsequious. A remarkable piece of acting.It is its faithfulness to the original that makes this drama so good. No one has ever written a more tightly plotted novel. Its series of climaxes make the novel difficult to put down; just as one plot-line reaches its climactic conclusion, another is building. And the duel of wits and sharp dialogue between Darcy and Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle) as they get to know each other is entrancing. And then comes that moment. She is at the piano befriending Darcy's sister, Georgiana (Emilia Fox), when he holds her gaze with a silent declaration of his love and admiration. This involved a fine piece of editor-timing; a split second either way, either too long or too short, and the poignancy of that moment would have been lost. It is interesting to compare Colin Firth's Darcy with that of Lawrence Olivier's Darcy in the Hollywood film. Olivier falsely portraits him as appealingly shy and self-conscious. But Darcy was in no way shy, he was just proud, with every reason to have a good opinion of himself. He found it impossible to imagine that anyone in a lower strata of society, living in a small provincial town, could be his equal - until he met Elizabeth!However, I felt there was one weak link in the chain of superb acting; Alison steadman. Many will disagree but I think she over-acted, turning her Mrs Bennet into a nerve- grating, neurasthenic caricature. But apart from that, I heartily recommend this video. Don't miss it. You'll not see its like again. I must just mention the charming piano music by Carl Davis, so beautifully evocative of a beautiful period in history (for the rich)."
"93","k-king2"," A masterpiece!","","12 July 2004","First let me state that I am a 30 something male who generally does not like chick flicks.  I have not seen any other version nor read the book.
The mini-series is just perfect.  It is a fantastic love story that is witty, charming, and very funny.  I am not sure how many times I have watched it now, at least 5, and it improves with each viewing.  The story and characters are so rich and interesting and the acting is just superb.  I have a Top Ten list of movies/shows based on the premise that you are stuck on an island and can only bring 10 movies with you to watch for the rest of your life.  This version of Pride and Prejudice has a permanent spot on that list.  I rarely give 9s when voting here and I give this a 10! 
If you like period pieces, good acting, or a great love story then this is a must see!"
"94","Tom_Benton"," Quite simply the most flawless thing I've ever seen.","10/10","29 June 2004","Much had I heard of Jane Austen's legendary classic, ""Pride and Prejudice"", and so to kick off my summer I set about reading it. It was possibly the greatest book I'd ever read. I looked up the different screen adaptations of it, and found that Colin Firth had starred in one (I previously enjoyed him in ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" - which is, in fact, a semi-remake of Austen's tale - and ""Love Actually""). So I traveled to my handy-dandy Borders store and picked up a DVD copy. As I walked out of the store, I hoped that I hadn't wasted $40 for this thing. And you know what?It was worth every last penny.""Pride and Prejudice"" is quite simply the most flawless thing I've ever seen. The story involves Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle), who's opinion changes greatly of a seemingly very proud, rude man that moves into town. To sum up the whole story would be impossible, as there isn't really a simple lot.First of all, let's examine the overall look of the thing. Simon Langton's direction is excellent, and he succeeds in getting the most breathtaking views of everything and anything. The production design and costuming is perfect, capturing the time without error, and the locations are simply gorgeous. Carl Davis' score is terrific and fitting (also to the times). Andrew Davies' script brings every last scene from the book and then pops in some new, being as absolutely faithful to the book as anyone could hope to be.But now on to the casting. The cast is outstanding, although the film's one problem (albeit a very slight one) is the role of Mrs. Bennet, who - although wacky in the book - is completely over-the-top here and quite frequently even annoying. But the stars of the film couldn't be better. Jennifer Ehle is absolutely wonderful as Lizzy Bennet, and her eyes are so dazzling that they mesmerized me throughout the whole 300 minutes! The show is completely stolen, however, by Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. Colin Firth is not just playing Mr. Darcy; Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy. He was born to play this role, and plays it so flawlessly, that it deserves to be considered one of the best performances any actor has ever given. Words cannot describe Firth's perfection as Darcy.All in all, ""Pride and Prejudice"" is the greatest thing ever to air on television, and were it a film, it would be the greatest film of all-time. Those of you who have read the book shouldn't worry a bit about the long running time of the mini-series; as impossible as it seems, you shan't even notice. When I finished the series, I had such a feeling of satisfaction as no entertainment has ever before granted me.This is perfection."
"95","nycritic"," The BBC Version","","12 April 2006","At 300 minutes, it might seem a bit steep to sit through -- after all, the novel is barely under 400 pages and its plot is concise enough to garner a shorter transition from book form to images. But, when you sit and read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, widely considered to be Jane Austen's magnum opus, and savor its miniaturist style, its sharp language, the treatment of even its minor characters as a huge tapestry, there is no other way to create a complete vision of the novel but to do a televised re-working of her novel. (The advent of Emma Thompson and the 2005 movie now proves otherwise.) The interesting aspect of the miniseries is that it never feels like it's moving at a crawl. The story of Austen's micro-society develops at its own pace, much like the novel: it's as if the novel had literally come alive and were being acted by the people from FAHRENHEIT 451, complete with costumes and settings. We meet the Bennets right at the beginning when they discuss how Netherfield is to be let at last, and that its owner is none other than an eligible bachelor. Elizabeth, the second eldest Bennet herself is the one who utters the opening line of Austen's book -- and it's appropriate that she be the one who does so: listen to how she says it, not to when she does or who she does to.The arrival of such a man causes an uproar it the small community. Charles Bingley is a congenial man, personable, but has some odious sisters, Caroline and Louisa Hurst. His friend, Mr. Darcy, is also eligible and ten times richer than Bingley, but is soon to be revealed to be someone disagreeable. At the ball, Jane Bennet becomes close with Charles (much to her mother's delight) and Elizabeth seen to be a little taken with the imposing nature of Darcy, but his aloof nature and continuous rebuffs, plus a harsh commentary he makes of her within earshot hurts her deeply: her pride has been hurt; hence, from now on, she will have nothing to do with him.But fate has her meet him again when Jane falls ill after she gets called to spend an evening with Bingley and his sisters. While Darcy seems to be taking a repressed liking to Elizabeth, she is unaware of it, and grows increasingly hostile towards him, particularly after learning from George Wickham that he behaved quite badly towards him. In the middle of this, and because the Bennets have no son, the girls stand no chance of inheriting. Their property has been entailed to a male heir. Reverend Collins comes looking for a wife, proposes to Elizabeth, gets rebuffed, and winds up marrying Charlotte Lucas -- Elizabeth's best friend. On top of this, the Bingleys leave Netherfield, and Jane's future is left up in the air.Eventually the plot reaches a head, and like the novel, it occurs midway. Jane Austen must have been aware at an empiric form that editing can balance out a work and enhance its effect, because in putting the crisis of the action halfway she establishes that Elizabeth and Darcy will have to shift towards each other in a realistic way, the same way other events will allow Jane and Bingley to consummate their union. This is what makes this story so enduring -- everything in it is realistic as possible, adhering to what society's attitude towards woman and men of their time was, where marriage was taken as serious as a retirement plan or having medical benefits. The miniseries captures the slow breakdown of Austen's plot in a way that could have been stagy but is not. Not one thread is left untold, unlike the 1940 version (despite the presences of Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson) where the story looked a little more like farce and characters in the book behaved much differently in that film version. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are perfect in their renditions of Elizabeth and Darcy. She resembles an earthier version of Meryl Streep down to her voice and mannerisms; he is as aloof as alluring. Who wouldn't believe they didn't have what it took to merge together? Both have to do much acting without expressing much if at all, yet Ehle brings a nice iconoclastic attitude towards her character, the same way Firth embodies masculine arrogance.Now, with the 2005 film version having got the praise it did, there will be people who prefer this version to the movie version and vice versa. There may be Olivier purists who will balk at such a long version. Having read the novel several times, I can relate to this one best because it retains pages of dialog intact without making it too talky and that's a tricky thing to do. Minus Alison Steadman's character, everyone is at a uniform level, but Steadman is a shade too shrill. While Mrs. Bennet wasn't the most agreeable person in the world, I believe that she has been represented better in the movie version because while still being a hyperactive, over-emotional woman, she was aware her daughters would be left destitute if they did not marry well. Even so, she does have a delicate tightrope to walk and I found myself liking Mrs. Bennet in the end and understood she was also a part of this enormous tapestry that Austen herself had woven so lovingly."
"96","Adriane"," Very true to the book (that's why it was worth watching)..","10/10","30 April 2001","I am a college student and I love reading classic literature. Jane Austen is one of my favorite writers of all time, and I was very happy with the movie versions of both Emma (with Gwyneth Paltrow) and Sense and Sensibility (with Emma Thompson & Kate Winslet). Both of the books are classics, and the movies are very true to their predescesors. This was no exception. I have read the book, and loved it, and I absolutely loved this mini-series. I was told by my English professor that it was the best version, and I was not happy with the version with Laurence Olivier. The cast was perfect, and how I loved seeing the relationship between Elizabeth & darcy unfold! One of the best 5 hours ever spent on a movie. 10/10"
"97","planktonrules"," Perfection.","","30 September 2012","Having read Jane Austin's novel and seen several other versions of the story, it's easy to believe that I adored this 1995 mini-series. Most of it is because Austin's book is one of the best and most beloved of the 19th century--and all the films try to cram all this wonderful material into only two hours (more or less). You simply cannot rush the great story and so many plots and subplots are omitted or rushed in other film versions. Here, however, there is five entire hours and the story is given what it deserves. It also deserved wonderful locations, acting, costumes and a screenplay--all which it has here.My advice is to see the other film versions--they're all pretty nice (even the Bollywood film ""Bride and Prejudice""). Then, buy yourself a copy of the 1995 mini-series, curl up and give it your undivided attention. Don't be surprised if five hours later you are finishing the film and using a few Kleenex! See this film!"
"98","denis888"," Classical masterpiece made a fantastic movie","10/10","11 July 2006","If there's a film that may be voted one of the best screen adaptations, then Pride and Prejudice is the one. From the very beginning, from the opening captions and sounds of the clavichord, you are tuned to a wonderful atmosphere of the 19th Century Britain. Everything is a winner in this excellent serial. Think of Mr. Bennet  cold, reserved, true English gentleman, kind at heart and somewhat ice on the surface. Think of absolutely unbeatable Miss Elizabeth Bennet, played by Jennifer Ehle, and here you see the marvelous portrait of a witty, smart, clever lady in full glory. And do not forget of Mr. Darcy, mastered by excellent Colin Firth  what a brilliant role! He looks so proud, so conceited at first, but then, as the film progresses, he warms up a little and becomes a charming elegant knight. One of the best roles is there of Mrs. Bennet, she is so convincing that you almost have to pinch yourself reminding that it is only a film! Every part in the film  Lady Catherine De Burgh, Lydia, Kitty, Jane, and Mr. Bingley  is excellently chosen and played with an exquisite touch that says much about the classical British film school. Scenery is another achievement here, one may only admire and contemplate over the majestic hills, green pastures and severely looking castles all around. Dances, costumes, music, mimic, manners, even language and food  all is executed with a precision that awakes admiration only. Solid 10 points  a masterpiece!"
"99","Red-125"," Excellent version of a great novel","","29 January 2017","""Pride and Prejudice"" (1995) is a BBC TV mini-series directed by Simon Langton. Pride and Prejudice is probably Jane Austen's most popular novel, and it comes to life in this film. (If you haven't read the novel, I would try to find a synopsis. The plot is complicated. Characters appear and you're not always certain where they fit in, or to whom they are related.)Jennifer Ehle portrays Elizabeth Bennet, the second of the five Bennet sisters, and the one with the most intelligence and the best grasp on reality. Susannah Harker plays Jane Bennet, also intelligent, but more gentle and loving than her younger sister. There are three other sisters, but only one of them figures prominently in the plot. Alison Steadman portrays Mrs Bennet, who is extremely foolish, but, in truth, is sometimes right.Important male characters are Benjamin Whitrow as Mr Bennet, who has not an ounce of romance in him, but respects his two older daughters.The male characters include Colin Firth as the brooding, fabulously wealth Mr. Darcy. Crispin Bonham-Carter portrays Mr. Bingley, also rich, but under Darcy's spell. Adrian Lukis is Mr. Wickham, who is able to charm everyone, until they know him better. David Bamber is the insufferable Mr. Collins.No one can deny the greatness of Jane Austen's book, and I think it will be considered a masterpiece as long as people read English novels. For IMDb, we reviewers have to review the film version of the novel. How well did the director and the actors reflect Austen's written word?I think that this version is a wonderful interpretation of the novel. The plot revolves around Elizabeth, and I think Ehle's portrayal is masterful. In the novel, she is considered attractive, but not conspicuously beautiful. (Jane is considered the great beauty.)What makes Ehle's acting wonderful is the expression in her eyes, and her beautiful smile. That smile tells us of her character. It's not a full cheerful smile--it's the smile of a woman who knows what is happening to her, and around her, and smiles in understanding.Colin Firth is an excellent actor. Maybe he broods a little too much, but who can say whether Jane Austen had that much brooding in her mind when she wrote her novel. One of our friends told us that the moment when Firth emerges from swimming in the lake, with his elegant white shirt clinging to his body, represents one of the great iconic moments of BBC television. I can accept that.We saw the film on the small screen. It was made for television, so clearly it should--and does--work well. However, if it's ever shown in a theater, I'd go to see it on the large screen. That's because the BBC production values are so high that the colors and scenery of the countryside would be shown to better advantage on a large screen.This 1995 P&P is a longer and better version of the 1980 version that I've also reviewed. However, the earlier version also has a great many good points. My suggestion--see them both."
"100","voltage11"," Capital! Capital!!!","10/10","1 May 2005","You just don't get much better than Pride and Prejudice, whether you're reading the book or watching the mini-series. I first saw P&P about four years ago, and it was my first taste of Jane Austen. It opened the world of classic literature to me and film adaptations of those classics.Now, of course, five and a half hours is a LONG time...but all the more to sit through! When you love something, it's fabulous to have it extended for as long as possible. This version is right on with the book; the conversations were practically ripped from the pages. If you've been a faithful fan of the book, you can rest easy that this is a faithful adaptation.As for the actors, it's hard to find anything bad to say. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth portrayed Lizzie and Mr. Darcy perfectly, and I have no qualms with putting their faces to the characters when reading the book. In fact, I can't think of one person I could complain about...they were all well suited.This is very light-hearted, wholesome entertainment that has become a favorite of nearly everyone who I've seen it with...including my dear dad. Well, not a favorite for him, but he enjoyed it very much! If you don't think you can sit for almost 6 hours, take it in spurts...although I have yet to see a friend ask me to stop if from boredom. Even my sister's ex-boyfriend sat through all 6 hours and enjoyed it. We've been lucky with men around here, apparently. ;) If you enjoy this, I also recommend Sense and Sensibility. Happy viewing!"
"101","nowego"," Perfection","","6 February 2011","This is one of the few series that I have been able to watch multiple times and not get bored. I am a 40+ male and I have watched this series many more times than my wife. She has watched it once and I have seen it at least 10 times.This is as close to perfection as you can get on many levels. I have read the book a few times and this adaption is so faithful to the book it could not have been done better and hasn't to date in my opinion.The casting is spot on and after seeing all of the other versions of Pride and Prejudice in movie form I cannot see anyone else playing Darcy other than Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is flawless as Elizabeth. Alison Steadman as Mrs Bennet and David Bamber as Mr Collins are just sublime. There are many other fantastic actors and characters who just make the series what it is, a must watch for anyone who likes period pieces, but it is also a must see for almost anyone with a brain, there is something in this for everyone no matter what age.This is 300 minutes of exquisite entertainment. 10 out of 10 for me."
"102","knightsofneech"," Probably the best BBC miniseries made-Austen would be proud...","10/10","20 September 2004","This adaptation of the Jane Austen novel is really incredible. Set design and costumes are very believable and the acting is practically perfect for most of characters.A few comments on costume: one of the most believable aspects of the details put into this miniseries has to do with the costumes. Elizabeth and Jane are both adorned simple enough to convey a Christian background and some decor and modesty, as they would have properly been dressed during this time, yet the costumers could have expanded their wardrobe as you see many times in American films (the 1999 version of Emma comes to mind here, particularly) and yet at the time, the women would *not* have had 10 different ensembles to wear at special events. I honestly admired the holding back of their wardrobes to a few gowns rather than having gone overboard as you often see! The women who were of higher stature were properly attired in their jewels and every costume fit the character and situation beautifully. This and the musical score are two of the biggest highlights, I felt.I would also like to give props to Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth who were cast wonderfully. Jennifer was able to convey a sort of devilish satire and quick wit which I thought suited her exceedingly well and accentuated the wit Austen was trying to get across in the novel. Firth held back and it suited his character. He shows a quiet power, a feeling of disdain and complexity in his acting that worked well for the first half of the miniseries and then turned this into admiration and openness later as the story develops. By the time he declares his undying love to Elizabeth you get the impression he is ready to burst open and you breathe a huge sigh of relief for him, yet the energy continues to pulse. Its a great thing to watch..I would recommend this miniseries to anyone, especially those not yet familiar with Austen. This specific miniseries is so well done many people I have watched it with have sparked incredible interests in the intrigues of Austen's works. Good job BBC!"
"103","lauraeileen894"," Definitive Jane Austen adaptation","","3 June 2007","The BBC miniseries version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" will undoubtedly be the yardstick by which all Jane Austen adaptations will be measured. Oh, there have been plenty of entertaining adaptations since then, such as ""Sense and Sensibility"" and the 2005 version of ""P&P"" with Keira Knightley, but it's safe to say that the classic miniseries is the definitive adaptation of a Jane Austen novel. Director Simon Langton captures the essential wit, satire, and suspense of Austen's most character-driven story. Twinkly-eyed, rosy-cheeked Jennifer Ehle makes a delightful Elizabeth Bennett, and she perfectly embodies Elizabeth's finest qualities: cool-headed, headstrong, witty and passionate. Elizabeth deserves to be placed in the same category of strong literary heroines such as Jo March and Scarlett O'Hara. You come to love Elizabeth as you watch her escape an engagement to the repulsive, simpering Mr. Collins (David Babson) and maintain her sanity among her foolish family members, including her hysterical mother (Allison Steadman) and her vapid, boy-crazy youngest sister Lydia (Julia Sawalha, playing the antithesis of her character from ""Absolutely Fabulous""). The supporting cast is also delightful, including Susannah Harker as Elizabeth's serene and lovely sister Jane, Crispin Bonham Carter as Jane's cheerful suitor Mr. Bingley, and Benjamin Whitrow as cynical Mr. Bennett.But let us not forget the real highlight of ""Pride and Prejudice"": Colin Firth's star making turn as the misunderstood (but no less dashing) Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth initially dislikes Mr. Darcy, but is surprised to find that he improves ""on closer acquaintanceship"". Firth plays Mr. Darcy as a man who is uptight and priggish on the outside, but warm, passionate, and romantic on the inside. Plus, it helps that Firth is criminally handsome and has soulful brown eyes that could melt even the coldest heart (oh, I'm such a girl!). The kiss at the end is one of the tender, romantic kisses I've ever seen on screen""P&P"" remains true to the spirit of Austen's story, so it doesn't pander to modern audience's expectations (if your tastes run towards explosions and sloppy sex scenes, this is not for you). Yet it remains delicious entertainment for people willing and patient enough to give it a try. Jane Austen, obviously, never lived to see her books made into film, but I think it's safe to say this brilliant miniseries would have made her glow with, well, pride."
"104","taloolah"," All- time favourite","10/10","14 November 2005","this will be very biased - I love this series and practically know it by heart. When my video tape was wrecked from rewinding, I finally got myself the DVD... and still love to watch it.This is the most complete adaption of the novel, and there are so many lovable details in it that just make it a very unique movie experience. There are however minor changes, due to the fact that each episode of the series had to be leaving the audience wanting more... but nothing that really differs from the original.The actors are awesome - Colin Firth is and will be the one and only Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle was a wonderful Elizabeth - spirited, lively, yet still always within decorum ( only that her skirts were "" 6 inches deep in mud, I assure you""). Jane is, although maybe not for our standards pretty, a very classic beauty, and very much in character.The Bingley sisters are wonderfully arrogant, and Bingley is such a nice guy - not the insipid undecided, but rather too much trusting those he holds dear. Mrs Bennet, though annoying, is wonderful, and Mr. Bennet, witty and sarcastic, a perfect choice....in short, the complete cast has so decidedly imprinted upon my image of the characters that I find it hard to imagine anyone else playing that particular role.The movie works very efficiently and elegantly with flashbacks to tell the various sub-plots, yet remains focused on the main actions. The scenery is well made, and the costumes are beautiful. I liked the fact that each actor had a wardrobe just as they would have had had they lived in the time, and not a new dress for each new scene.For us, it may be hard to acquaint oneself with the language of Jane Austen, the rules of decorum of her time, and the social standards and sets of rules. In watching the movie, a lot of these things come clear - visualization as a means of understanding the regency period.On a last note - the music is awesome. I have the opening melody as my cellphone ring ever since my Cellphone was able too...;) There are so many little details, over which discussions can be lead for hours and hours, or pages and pages, and this s one of the best parts about the movie - although it gives an interpretation, it is not finite. A perfect movie to visualize the novel,and a must-see."
"105","pri_e"," Can watch this thousands of times","","11 August 2001","When I first heard of this movie I hadn't read the book yet so I just scoffed at the idea of it.  I finally did read the book and was absolutely moved by it. My favourite  movie is the 1996 version of ""Emma"" with Gwyneth Paltrow so I was looking up other titles and just figured since it was acclaimed worldwide I'd check it out for myself. I was addicted to it !! Once I started watching I had to go right through to the end, it was such a brilliant adaption. I thought Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth had amazing chemistry, they were perfect as Elizabeth and Mr Darcy. The rest of the cast were excellent as well, this is definitely one movie for the romantics and even for comedy."
"106","TheLittleSongbird"," Pride and Prejudice-simply sublime!","10/10","30 January 2010","The book by Jane Austen is amazing, and deservedly one of the best loved books ever. Out of the numerous adaptations I have seen of this fabulous book, this one is what I call the most definitive of the lot. To sum up this adaptation in one word, sublime would sum it up wonders.Everything was perfect, from the period detail, music, acting, direction to the scripting. The adaptation looks exquisite; the photography is crisp, the costumes are gorgeous and the scenery is breathtaking. I loved the music too, I look out for this all the time, and the music was so pleasant and soothing.The direction is stylish, and the script is witty and intelligent while sticking true to the spirit of the book. And of course the performances, everyone involved did superbly. Colin Firth makes a fine Mr Darcy, handsome, dashing and intelligent, and Jennifer Ehrle is an attractive, witty and spirited Elizabeth.Everybody else did just as well, even better in some cases. Particularly Anna Chancellor as Miss Bingley, an inspired choice and plays her like an aloof yet sophisticated sort of character. And Barbara Leigh-Hunt was outstanding as Lady Catherine. David Bamber and Harriet Escott also stood out.Did I have a favourite scene? Not really, I was utterly captivated by it all, but I have to say the ballroom scenes were gorgeous to watch. In conclusion, I am running out of things to say about this adaptation. It was just delightful, and I got so much pleasure watching it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Jennifer Ehle is equally good as the charming but prejudiced Lizzy.  I also enjoyed Benjamin Whitrow as the father of ""the five silliest girls in England"" and Alison Steadman's hilarious rendition of Mrs. Bennett.  I immediately bought the tapes and have watched them over and over.I recommend this mini series to everyone. It far exceeds the films made of Austen's works.  Emma (and Gywnneth Paltrow) pales in comparison with this A&E mini series.I, too, enjoyed Bridget Jones Diary all the more because of Colin Firth's Mark DARCY."

"109","Kreme"," Easily the best Jane Austen adaptation ever made","","23 March 2000","This mini-series, easily the best version of any Jane Austen book I've ever seen, is also one of the very best mini-series ever made. The acting, staging, directing, and costumes are perfect. There's not a glance or bonnet out of place. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are not only the best Elizabeth Bennett and Darcy, but are also magnificently well matched. They sparkle every time they share the screen. Be careful when you start watching it, because chances are you will have to watch the entire 6 hours at one sitting. Oh, and the dialog is basically word for word from the book; so one can really see Jane Austin's words come alive. This is one of the very few films that actually improves the enjoyment of the book. See it, read it, see it again, read it again.07/01/05 It's been nearly six years since I wrote that, and there's been more than a few adaptations of Jane Austen's best novel since. Everything I said still holds, this is far and away the best version out there. Kudos to Keira Knightly for her recent (2005) performance, but Jennifer Ehle nailed Elizabeth Bennet and it is quite impossible to imagine anyone ever doing as good a job, and better is simply not possible.I've seen the mini series many times now, as I am one of those odd people who read Miss Austen every year or so, and watching the mini-series has now become a regular part of my Austen rotation."

First, you have to trust all the good reviews in the world and start watching. Second, you will enjoy this show starting from the first episode. Third, nobody will tell you to continue watching further, but you will anyway. Then after finishing this show, you thank your friend. Or should I say you will thank yourself because you chose to finish this show? Doesn't really matter.I find at least 3 reasons why people are doubting this show.First. ""Isn't this show just like any other friendships movie/series?"". Short answer, it's NOT. Don't get me wrong, any kind of good friendships film will definitely warm your heart, I always love friendships films. However, there are too many other treasures to talk about that you can find in this show. Role of moms, dads, admirers, crushes, dreams, siblings, fate, boys gang, girls gang, exes, education, morals, marriages. And why are they even important? Because you will then REALLY understand to be in other people's shoes.Second. ""There are not much going on in 1988, is this even relevant? Isn't this extremely boring?"". Well, definitely you won't find any fancy things here. No fancy fiction things just like any other korean dramas, no major plot twist or whatsoever. My question is, why is that even a problem? Really you don't have to worry all of those questions. The show will still feel very close to us that you really want to be one of the characters. Unfortunately, rewatching the show again and again will be the only way you can make your dream come true.Third. ""I can guess the plot. There is one girl in those friendships, so it will just be triangle or rectangle love story, just like any others."" Again. Please do yourself a favor not to worry these things. There are sooo many things that you can talk about rather than worrying if there is good romance aspects or not.Last thing I want to remind you because you have arrived to this review.
PLEASE. THANK. YOUR. FRIEND."

"130","7ZEN"," An authentic portrayal of the 85-90's period!","10/10","23 December 2018","Initially, I would have started this review with ""first of all""... but it would have been inconsistent with the tens of ""first of all"" I'd started with. Why? Because this Korean drama is amazingly accurate in depicting the '85-90's period and idiosyncrasies!... And this appreciation comes from a non-Korean, non-Asian, Hollywood movie-goer, >30's person. Nevertheless, I have never seen a more realistic depiction of common people and their struggles throughout that particular period. I know what I'm talking about because I've experienced it in my neighbourhood and with my family. Because of this and others more, I felt compelled to add my unacquainted review to IMDb.
Bottom line... if you really want to see some great acting (Kudos to the actors!!!) and get an amazing feel of the 85-90's (and this is coming from a non-American, non-Western point of view), I highly recommend this series!"
"131","shaheenharandi"," I loved it. I will miss it.","","3 August 2020","I felt so close to the characters in the story. Now that it's finished, I feel I will miss it. I don't think I've ever felt that so much as I do with this series. I am relatively new to Korean TV series, and am not well-versed in Korean culture, nevertheless, I loved every thing about this show. It walked me through the happy occasions as well as trials and tribulations of friends in a small neighborhood in Korea, set in 1988. You see the characters develop, while failing and succeeding in their individual endeavors. Ultimately, it all comes together into an incredibly warm and at times emotional conclusion. This show made me nostalgic for something I never experienced. That is quite a feat."

"135","iansalvacion"," Best Kdrama I have watched in years.","","17 August 2020","Best Kdrama I have watched in years. It officially dethrones My Mister (My Ahjussi) as my favorite Korean series.Reply 1988 is set in the year 1988, it revolves around five friends and their families living in the same neighborhood of Ssangmun-dong, Dobong District, Northern Seoul.This series resonates the family values that everyone should foster but most failed to accomplish. Reply 1988 teaches its audience about hope, generosity, unconditional love, gratefulness, friendship, hard work, perseverance, acceptance and a lot more. It's so good that it knocks your humanity and questions your core values. The series has no villain but only misfortunes and heartbreaks. The show's impact lingers to your senses and encourages you to choose the good path, appreciate your loved ones more and be the best version of yourself.Reply 1988 has 20 episodes with more than an hour long each. Despite of that, it never wavered its greatness from beginning to end. I cried and laughed almost every episode. None of the characters has failed to deliver. Even young Jin-ju's cuteness will leave you a mark. Watch out for Jung-Bong! This young man has skills and tricks up his sleeves.One of the photos for this post is Jung-hwan and Duk-seon. Why? Because I shipped them so much and I extremely felt sad when the show ended without giving their romance a chance. Not even a genuine confession. Nonetheless, I am celebrating because the two actors who portrays those characters are dating in real life.The camaraderie of Ssangmun-dong neighborhood is unparalleled. It manifests how a small community builds, changes and cultivates someone's life and legacy. If this series doesn't move you, it's time to evaluate your values and principles.Watch this series and thank me later."

It was so relatable even though it's from a different timeline and a different country. It's heartwarming, funny and makes you feel empty when it's over. The second time I watched it I was depressed for 3 days because it felt like I've lost life long friends, it's that good and I know I'll feel the same again. I was amazed that it was the first time I didn't have any complaints with a drama. Great acting, great story, great music. You'll feel like you're watching normal people live their lives but it's interesting."

It sets these series apart from others. Really unique! I'd highly recommend if you enjoy nostalgia shows and Kdrama! And I'm shred you'll enjoy who the girl marries in this one too.

This show is one of the best shows i've watched in a while. I liked how this didn't focus only on the leads' romance but the love between friends, and family. I feel like i grew up with them, in that same Ssangmundong street 10-2. I laughed,cried, screamed at the characters every episode like i was a part of their group. It was so heartwarming to see all the relationships between the families..i mean where do we get to see friends like this and neighbours bonding with each other!
This show was so realistic without being overly dramatic and cringy(i like that too ;) ) The best thing about this was the simplicity of the show and the characters. They didn't use mobile phones or any hi-tech gadgets..it was just pure communication with landline phones and face to face <3
This show taught me the value of friendship and family.
I cried more in this last episode than i did in any other episode
Thankyou, the families and friends living in Ssangmundong. I'm glad i grew up with you. T.T
I'll make sure i visit often."

"145","alaningle7"," Rose tinted spectacles","","4 October 2020","A nostalgic look as a group of families living in Seoul. The highs and lows as they face heartbreak, disappointment, and success and jubilation. Each episode is one and a half hours and is quite slow in evolving the drama, but is well acted and the underlying story of we may be poor but we are richer in many other ways is the theme. Although it is a romanticised and dramatic account of family life, people will recognise small snippets of their own families. A little too sentimental for my tastes but I can understand why people rate it so highly as it does have a rich positive message."

"147","drsearch"," An absolute gem to watch","","15 December 2020","After Parasite winning the Oscars, I became curious in other film and TV works from Korea. I watched Reply 1988 and it opened a whole new world to me. I have never seen a TV show like this. It was absolutely amazing how well the storylines are written and the characters are developing each episode.The cast is top notch. They blend drama, romance and comedy perfectly. The older experience cast gave the story richness. The younger cast did an amazing job and the chemistry was real. This is what real friendship looks like. Their coming-of-age story lines are touching and entertaining.The show is much more than the often discussed love triangle. It shows love in a much broader and deeper way between friends, parents, siblings and family.The story has a lot depth. It has references to actual events happening at the end of the 80s, like the Seoul Olympics and the pro-democracy protests. It captures that zeitgeist perfectly. I did not understand all the cultural references to pop culture around that time, but I could certainly appreciate it.Reply 1988 is Korean, but at the same time it tells a universal story in a unique and brilliant way. Therefore, it transcends different cultures. It will actually teach you valuable life lessons. And that makes this show an absolute gem to watch."
"148","rallymotor"," One of the best series I have ever seen.","10/10","7 November 2022","I don't watch a whole lot of tv series, but I have to say this is one of the most amazing series I have ever watched. I think this show relates to people who are between their mid 40s-50s. Those who grew up in a tight small neighborhood. Lot of subject or environment the story brought up is relatable to my childhood years. The additional drama of love relationships just added a heart warming touch to keep you interested with the show. This series made me want to keep watching it and I really hated when it had to end, but it was such a great ending. Highly, highly, highly recommended for anyone who wants a happy nostalgic, fantasy-like story but slightly similar to your own childhood. Everyone in the show was great, perfect for their part and just fun to watch. Teared up many times throughout."
"149","Glue2Screen"," a perfectly balanced narrative filled with comedy, mystery, drama, romance, and history","","26 November 2022","Reply 1988 is like that average looking sandwich you purchased without much thought from a mom-pop diner, but ends up being the most delicious sandwich you ever tasted. This series began underwhelmingly and sneaks up on you with over-abundance of love, joy, laughter, hope and bittersweet nostalgia.It somehow manages to create a beautiful dichotomy of simplicity in its overall plot with complexity of being human.The main reason Reply 1988 is so amazing is its purposefully segmented shooting/editing style and non-chronological method of story-telling by the writers. Each episode is carefully interwoven with multiple stories but each story does not present itself fully. Rather, each narrative would come to a pause without a resolve then shift onto other narratives before ultimately gently steering the viewers back to the initial narrative. These shifts in stories aren't always chronological yet it doesn't feel jarring when it moves onto another. Instead, it feels like a cleverly way to give each episode a smidge of mystery and allowing viewers to hold onto pieces of the puzzle.On top of the creative storytelling, the astounding acting from the cast helped to make Rely 1988 one of my favourite.Hyeri (who plays Daek Sun) is phenomenal in her subtlety in facial expressions, fearlessness in looking/acting foolish, impactful monologues, compelling inept dancing skills (I honestly believed that she couldn't dance, only to later be pleasantly surprised to then discover Hyeri is this amazing kpop star) and her genuine smiles.Kyung-Pyo, Ryu, Bo-Gum & Dong-hwi (who portrays the main four guys) does an amazing job in capturing their respective characters' with enough slapstick comedy to keep you laughing but also sincerity in their emotions.Ra Mi-ran (who portrays Mi-ran) and Sun-Young are my favourite mothers. These two also aren't afraid of making themselves look ridiculous, which really helped keep the tone of the series.The music and sound effects (baaaaa) also plays a huge part in making Reply 1988 so good. Each song that plays not only keeps in part with the era (1980s/1990s), steeping you further into the time period. The song also cleverly bounces between music in background for mood verses music the characters can hear (for those interested: non-diegetic vs diegetic). Then on top of this, the series use of the sound effect really helps to set the comedic tone.The dialogue also another factor in what made this series great. It was well written and delivered to be tender-hearted, hysterical, manic and loving when it needed to be. The use of voice-over to deliver the underlining theme of the episode is quite impactful.My only complaints are foreign set decor and use of foreign language (an occurrence in many dramas). Whenever this series goes to China, the sets and spoken mandarin really threw a wrench in the enjoyment. The set decor is wildly over populated with ornate patterns and the colour red. It is as if the show was worried we wouldn't understand the fact the characters are in China. Also the heavily accented Mandarin spoken by supposedly fluent Chinese characters was bit of a soreness.Overall, despite minor flaws, Reply 1988 is one awesome wholesome heartfelt show that I plan to rewatch again. Even though it wasn't my culture nor an era I really remember, I felt deep connections with many of the stories that took place. There was so much FEELS in this series that I haven't fully reflected on everything.Highly recommended is an understatement. PLEASE if you ever get a chance...just hit the ""play"" button. You won't regret it."

Amazing."

There's a reason it's so well received.","","15 October 2022","Peaky Blinders is a tale that is extremely loosely based on an actual English gang in the 19th century. It's a story about anti-heroes, characters who you'd despise in real life, but who also generate feelings of sympathy from the audience. It's such a well made show, very engaging, and there's just something so special about it that makes it irresistible. I even tried to lose interest at one point, but found myself longing for more, I had to continue. And Cillian Murphy just kills it. He has proven he is lead-character worthy.Do yourself a favor and give this show a chance. It's well deserving of that. It's full of great acting, interesting plot developments, and fantastic camerawork. Be warned, you might find yourself a bit obsessed with it as well."

The acting and writing is what makes this show so special but the attention to detail they put into every aspect of this show is amazing.

"180","grantss"," Superb","10/10","27 January 2019","(Review updated after Season 6).Birmingham, England, 1919. In the aftermath of WW1, the Shelby family are making a name for themselves as bookmakers, racketeers and gangsters. Nominally the head of the family is the oldest brother, Arthur, but the real brains, ambition and drive in the organisation lies with Tommy, the second oldest. He will carve out an empire for himself that will stretch beyond Birmingham. This with the aid of his family and his gang, the Peaky Blinders.Superb drama, created and written by Steven Knight. Gritty, realistic, intriguing and highly entertaining. Some great machinations, subterfuges, plots and counter-plots plus a good amount of action and human drama. Think The Sopranos set in the UK in 1919.Some very clever storylines and plot developments. They sometimes threaten to become implausible and random (especially as the series goes on) but have a way of fitting together and all making sense at the end.Great work by the main performers: Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory, Paul Anderson, Sophie Rundle and Joe Cole. The secondary/guest performances include some big names: Sam Neill, Tom Hardy, Aiden Gillen, Adrien Brody, Noah Taylor. Tom Hardy is the pick of the bunch, as Alfie Solomons.Great soundtrack too. Though set in the early-20th century, the music is mostly rock, and it works. Despite being anachronistic, the music works, giving the series an edgy feel. It starts with the theme track - Nick Cave's excellent 'Red Right Hand', a song that seems to fit Tommy Shelby perfectly. It continues with the scene-specific music and includes some great tracks. For example, in one episode alone you have Radiohead's 'Climbing Up The Walls', Joy Division's 'Atmosphere' and Black Sabbath's 'War Pigs'.In addition, the show went out on a high, while it was still quality viewing. By Season 5 cracks were starting to appear: the plot in Season 5 was a bit loose and unfocused and ends rather clumsily, compared to previous seasons. Still great, but not as good as previous seasons and a sign that it had run its course.The worry then was that Steven Knight would just phone it in for a few seasons to milk more money out of it and just end up ruining the legacy of the show. However, Season 6 is a great finale: focused, short and sharp, wrapping things up in style."
"181","classicsoncall"," ""I think what it is, you're bad men, but you're our bad men."" - Ep. #1.6 - Former Garrison owner Harry to Tommy Shelby","","10 June 2020","I'm late to the party here as I have been for anything appearing on network or cable TV since 'Seinfeld' went off the air. But it's gratifying in one way, as I've been able to watch the (so far) complete five seasons of ""Peaky Blinders"" over the course of a few weeks without losing a sense of continuity. I have to say, this is one of the best series I've seen, on a par with shows like HBO's ""Deadwood"" and ""Carnivale"", though this one comes courtesy of Netflix and the BBC. The acting is impeccable, with a strong cast led by Cillian Murphy as the notorious Tommy Shelby, leader of the Peaky 'effing' Blinders, as the characters manage to remind us in just about every episode. Without knowing what the title refers to, it becomes clear in a fourth season episode I think, when Finn Shelby (Harry Kirton) earns his brotherly status in the organization by using the razor blade in the peak of his cap to register his initiation murder for the gang. The machinations of the Shelby's are sometimes difficult to follow if you're not attentive, as their alliances and enemies have a way of criss-crossing from one side to another, but suffice it to say, the gypsy blood in the Shelby's generally manage a way to insure their triumph over perceived adversaries. The series is set in 1920's Birmingham, England, with the period detail strikingly imaginative and real. With not a weak actor in the ensemble, it's hard to pick a favorite among the killers and assassins who populate the story lines, but for whatever reason, I happen to take a shine to Harry Kirton as Shelby sidekick Johnny Dogs, who has just the right blend of malice and humor to appear as a well regarded henchman. It will be interesting to see where the story goes next with the start up of Season Six whenever it comes to pass. You can just about bet that there will be more than one instance that result in 'the bleak midwinter'."

"183","ahmetkozan"," The Peaky Blinders Rises!","","8 January 2019","In Peaky Blinders we follow a family after the First World War that is always looking for power and money. But a policeman arriving at the city is looking to stop this family, but it's not easy. It will also be noticeable the segregated fight of ghettos like Italians, gypsies, local gangsters and Jews. Peaky Blinders is an excellent gangster drama full of rich, interesting and diverse characters. The fact that Peaky Blinders is a crime series can give the impression that characters are macho men. But this is not true. The series also incorporates many powerful female characters. It has an excellent cast and script. Thomas is a character who uses his strategic intelligence and applies violence to his own ends without hesitation. The film music is the highlight of the series along with Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy. The director does resort to a modern soundtrack that reflects the fiction.It is estimated that one episode of the series is worth 1 million and 1.5 million euros. This means a rich, detailed and beautiful work of art. Constantly supporting the narrative structure visually, Peaky Blinders often touches upon the working conditions of the working class in Birmingham. Peaky Blinders, with a color scale that chooses to contrast between pale blues and greens, and contrasts with the shades of red, makes the strongest manifestation of emotions in the midst of this unknown, while attributing a distinct obscurity to Birmingham's misty air. Also, the visual effects used from time to time are quite clever. The visual effects used are also quite compatible with the historical theme of the series.Peaky Blinders makes each episode a separate action and drama. It's a breathtaking series where you can see the rise of Peaky Blinders. 9/10"

The storyline with the dark industrial atmosphere form Birmingham post World War One all adds up to be one of the shows you can't dislike. The costumes and the surroundings are all perfect.

The story is interesting,the acting is brilliant and the cinematography is just beautiful!I am eagerly waiting for the next episodes.When I compare Peaky Blinders to other popular TV shows that use sex,brutality and violence to shock the audiences and get high ratings(which they actually do)this sincere work is like needlework;fine,classy and detailed.The makers of this drama have not chosen the easy way,they have set off to make a first class period drama,that dares to be different.Cillian Murphy is at his best,I will even go as far as to say that this is one of the best performances I have seen of him.Sam Neil and Helen McCrory must be praised,all casting is perfect.Peaky Blinders sets high standards for other television dramas to follow."
"190","Lejink"," Razor sharp","9/10","10 January 2018","Missed this highly regarded series when first broadcast some years ago but was encouraged to watch it by friends and caught up with series one over the festive period. Personally I had no knowledge of the gang-wars in post WWI Birmingham involving the Irish, gypsy and the local community, but found the story of middle brother Tommy Shelby's seemingly irresistible rise to kingpin status wholly involving and entertaining.It's easy to compare this drama with Scorsese's Hollywood take on the gangs of New York, but I hated that film with its cliched characterisations, violence just for violence sake depictions and some terrible over-acting, especially by Daniel Day-Lewis. There's very little of that in ""Peaky Blinders"" as it makes very few false-steps with a believable array of characters, carefully injected but not overdone scenes of brutality and convincing playing by its well-cast ensemble.Central to everything is the coming-man Tommy, played with cold-eyed efficiency by Cillian Murphy, usurping his older brother Arthur (Paul Anderson) in the process. There's a tearaway younger brother too and a sister who happens to love Tommy's one-time best pal, now a firebrand Communist agitator and a matriarchal aunt cannily played by Helen McCrory.The scene setting of the Birmingham slums, streets and factories is superbly done almost like a time machine has planted the viewer right there all those years ago. The linked stories of the six first episodes crescendo to a thrilling climax as Tommy takes on his established rival, a big-time racetrack bookie and takes in the involvement, make that entanglement with a pretty new Irish waitress who isn't all that she seems.However a senior police officer's mutual fascination with her was really the only missed step in the narrative especially its rather silly, overdone culmination at the conclusion of the first series finale but I now can't wait to further witness Tommy's inexorable rise in future series in what may be the best reason yet for binge-watching boxed sets to my knowledge."
"191","BeneCumb"," Stylish gangster drama with realistically captured atmosphere","","20 June 2016","/refers to Seasons 1-3/In general, I am not particularly fond of series depicting criminal gangs, as there is too much swearing and violence, wrong values are promoted via lifestyle glorification, etc. But as I have always liked Cillian Murphy, I decided to dedicate dozens of hours to watch this series in succession.The first episode was largely not too promising - the mood was too depressive, with WWI reminiscences, and it seemed that Murphy and Sam Neill would strongly dominate over other actors... But then it all changed and I grew steadily accustomed to the environment, location and period I am not very familiar with. Acting became a talented team work, and minor characters obtained their time and place to show their demand to be included into this sophisticated course of events. The rich cried too, and the famous died too - so one could not easily guess what would happen next. Additional points from me for the selection of music/songs, providing a deepening atmosphere to this not-so-bright life in the industrial town of Birmingham.Apparently, the biggest value of this series is realistic depiction of both the venue and characters; even the gangsters are no numb bullies, but persons capable of versatile strong feelings and deeds. And each action has its reasons - as well as consequences.So I am looking forward to new seasons already - Season 4 was strong again.PS Season 5 has apparently the most compact dialogs, Season 6 is a nice round-up - and with a nice twist in the end... The pace is somewhat slower and Murphy spends more time on screen alone, but still - a very strong series."
"192","Neptune165"," Tom Hardy and Cillian's scenes in the show are pure gold","10/10","24 June 2023","Cillian is very quiet and tends to give short answers in most interviews but he is so engaged in this one. Cillian's portrayal of Tommy Shelby is truly the stuff of legend. Undoubtedly one of if not the most magnificent, remarkable, phenomenal performances I've ever seen by any actor. The power Tommy possesses and the ways in which he conveys that power and imposes it upon other people to threaten, challenge and warn them of all at the same time and with such an incredible degree of stoic gravitas as well, how he can demonstrate such incredible, forceful power using nothing but his eyes is nothing short of miraculous. Cillian crafted every single aspect of Tommy's character to absolute perfection. From his subtle mannerisms, to his vocabulary and speech patterns, to the way he presents himself to the people around him and the exceptionally intricate ways he articulates his words, to how he so masterfully interprets how extraordinarily intelligent Tommy is and how he utilises that intelligence to strategise the downfall of his enemies and opponents, it really solidifies the fact that Tommy's intelligence is the most powerful and invaluable weapon Tommy has at his disposal, Cillian interprets the harrowing levels of destructive trauma Tommy has both emotionally and psychologically in such a remarkable manner. The ways in which he immerses and subjects the audience to the devastating, internal battles Tommy forces himself to endure with his inner demons that cause him such horrific devastation and poison both his mind and his soul is absolutely magnificent. Tommy is such a complex character with so much incredible depth, and Cillian embodied how conflicted he is as a character in such a masterful way that's truly beyond artistic perfection. I am for both Cillian and Tommy all day, but to refrain from boring you all to the point of suicide and I'm going to proceed to summarise this little rant of mine by saying Cillian's performance as Tommy is historically phenomenal and I strongly doubt any other acting performance in any other TV show could ever possibly compare."
"193","benmundie"," Season 6 *audible sigh*","","1 May 2022","'Peaky Blinders' season six *audible sigh*.This was by far the show I was most looking forward to this year. The final season of one of the best TV Shows ever put to screen. A show that had it all throughout its tenure, unbelievable acting leading to some of the most recognisable and iconic characters from the last decade of television. Long term storytelling that rivals most shows. A huge backlog of brilliant supporting characters that have carefully and meticulously been built up over the last five seasons of this show, amongst so much more. Sadly the writers seemed to forget about that for this final season, favouring to develop new characters (along with Tommy Shelby) that have very little impact on the overall plot whilst household names like Arthur Shelby (Paul Anderson) go backwards in regard to character development and Ada Thorne (Sophie Rundle) is barely on screen.It is very well-known that the tragic passing of series regular Helen McCrory (Polly Gray) is a notable reason for the assumed rewrites that had to take place before shooting. It is likely this was the reason for the reduction in screen time for expected main antagonist Michael Gray (Finn Cole) as their stories were intertwined with each other.Let's start with the main positive, the acting. Throughout all six seasons of this show the one consistent takeaway is the acting. After five seasons of playing the same character, Cillian Murphy clocked in one last time as the legendary Tommy Shelby, he bought the calm yet explosive nature that the character has adopted over the past five years. The big surprise for me this year was Natasha O'Keeffe as Lizzie Stark. Her presence on the show was increased massively from previous seasons with a much larger focus being put on Tommy's immediate family. She really shines in the emotional moments from the season, which there are plenty scattered throughout. There are other good performances as well, none of which I think are as good as these two. The problem with some is that they're overshadowed by the confusing direction the writers decided to go in with that particular character.Let's discuss the writing. What happened? This show has been one of the more consistently brilliant and entertaining shows since its inception in 2013 but for some reason it seems that the writing went backwards and the show became boring in places. Many people (myself included) felt that the writing began to decline slightly last season (season five), it had become too political and that only increased this time round with the rise of the Nazi party before World War II and the introduction of characters like Jack Nelson (James Frecheville) and Diana Mitford (Amber Anderson). As previously mentioned, this show has always had a large collection of well-developed characters that have been backed by a great cast but they decided to push the key supporting ones to the background in favour of some other new ones that are instantly forgettable. Starting with the most confusing which is Conrad Kahn as Tommy's new illegitimate son 'Duke Shelby' (yes, I did have to look up his name because like most people I had forgotten it.) The character is fine, I guess. The actor does a good enough job, the reason this creative decision perplexes me is not directly about the character himself, it's the choice of promoting him more than a character who has been there since the start like Finn Shelby (Harry Kirton). The confusing nature of this is extenuated by the fact that these two characters occupy a very similar role in the show. They're both younger members of the family that have a lot to learn and both spend this season learning what it means to be a Shelby. That's why I don't understand them choosing to focus more on Duke than an established character like Finn.In my opinion, this season desperately needed more episodes. I understand that all previous seasons had six episodes so it makes sense for them to want to keep it consistent but they needed to make an exception this time round because there were too many characters and plot points that ended up with a dissatisfying ending. This would've allowed some characters to obtain more screen time that they desperately needed to be able to finish their respective stories and character arcs. The biggest example of this is Michael Gray. He had been set up, especially in season five, as the main antagonist. He had directly opposed Tommy as the head of the family and wanted to lead the Peaky Blinders into a new age. However, Michael was barely even in half of the episodes and had very little amount of screen time with Tommy Shelby resulting in a lack of growth for this storyline, which for me was the most intriguing one going into the season.Despite the numerous negatives that were apparent throughout, there were definitely other positives. One of which being the camera work. In previous season the camera work had always been solid but not really something to call home about but this year they really stepped it up with some lovely one-shot scenes to build tension and to reflect the feelings of the characters on scene. The cinematography also seemed to take a step up especially in the final episode. There are some beautiful visuals throughout which give the show a stylised perspective, something that we have never really had in this show. It is a welcome addition to the already stacked merits that this show has held over the years.In conclusion, as brilliant as this show has been for the past five years this season was a huge drop in quality. The misguided idea to focus on new characters over the originals that have unfinished arcs was confusing that genuinely doesn't make sense. The acting can only carry a show so far and at some point the writing needed to catch up and sadly it didn't. There are rumours that they're currently in pre-production for a spin-off film, I will of course watch it and am looking forward to it, hopefully they can rectify some of their mistakes here.7/10."
"194","korereviews"," More music video than TV show","9/10","8 December 2017","Peaky Blinders is all style and no substance. Endless slow-motion shots to dramatic music of characters walking, smoking cigarettes, or squinting into the distance. The priority is clearly to make everyone look cool: cool when they're engaging in brutal violence, cool when they're suffering or dying, cool when they're eating breakfast. Every shot is either like a music video or a fashion magazine spread in period costume. The characters are props - lifeless mannequins. None of them feel like actual people, nor are they meant to. The actors here are all good, but they have nothing to do but pose. We're just supposed to be dazzled by how cool they look and sound. The fact that so many viewers seem to think this show is gritty and realistic is a depressing commentary on how on we as a society can no longer tell the difference between the fake and the authentic (and how little we care about the difference). This show and others of its ilk (like the even more popular Taboo) are just nihilism photoshopped to look sexy. Superficially seductive, empty at the core."
"195","knifemagnet"," Getting a little tired now going into season five","","10 October 2019","Early on I loved this show. Eventually it is like watching the same episode over and over again. There is no depth of characters like we see in shows like Boardwalk Empire. Prior to watching season five I decided to watch season four again. The slow motion shots should go out the window at this point - it's just getting plain ridiculous. Add to that shots of characters parading into a room, with an air that they are the coolest people alive, like a teen given better clothes and a better hair cut on the first day of school - that is also really trying my patience. If I were asked what character recently portrayed on film annoyed me most I'd have a hard time thinking of anyone else but Arthur; if I was a Peaky Blinder I'd shoot him myself. But this is perhaps due to a good character, played by a good actor, that is irritating. Above all though, the vast majority of the music irritates me; could they not blend music of the time while retaining Nick Cave's intro and randomly chosen outros? Or how about the cliche parts where Tom never meets a woman that isn't ready to drop their panties for him - is this something that was borrowed from that awful show Entourage? And so, my struggle to get through season five goes forward. I've gone from a 9/10 at the end of season three, to a 7/10, and now to a 6/10. Wish me luck. Season six? No thanks."

Characters are solid, the acting is mostly good I specially like Hardy, but some characters like Polly are very inconsistent and becomes pretty annoying for no good reason other than to keep conflict going in the family. Everything is a little too dreamy plotwise and puts me off with a slight cringe from time to time, its a bit hard to care about the characters when they dont have enough depth, I think it just needs better planning to be what it wants to be, though overall it is good enough, I can appreciate the level of production it has and is undoubtly better than many other shows out there, just not quite among the best, I am very surprised it has an 8.8 average at this point, its more like an 8.4"

"199","dk777"," Pretentious Blinders","","14 January 2021","Certainly had potential, started very interesting, but it quickly became repetitive and boring.Too bad, because the cinematography is good and the actors are not bad. It is hard to take this show seriously, especially with such unlikable characters.The music is great, but it doesn't fit into the series at all. The show is interesting at times, but it is too pretentious and the dialogues are too modern.It started out interesting, the concept is intriguing, as well as the period in which the action takes place, but it soon became repetitive, with a lot of slow motion shots. In each episode we have a small video where people walk in slow motion and someone smokes.The characters are simply too modern at the time, their reactions and the topics they talk about are so unrealistic that the show would function better as a comedy.Some parts are hilarious, the series itself is so pretentious that it is impossible to take it seriously. The production and costume design are excellent, but the script is not at that level, it is typical for today's film production.Another pretentious show set in the past, with characters who act as if they are from the present day."

Everything about it was so great, the acting the writing, the directing etc. It drew me in from the first few episodes. The characters are attractive and likeable despite of course the role they play in the series. The series give you an insight on England in the 1920,30s and a peek at some of the social and political conditions at the time. Cillian Murphy the actor portraying Tommy was so crucial for the huge success of this show, however the support of the rest of the cast was very important, for example Arthur Shelby gave this series a distinct flavor that without him it would have been much less interesting. I wanted the series to go beyond season 6. I was sad when it ended. I will miss watching it, miss the characters, being with them for so long, they became like friends."

"227","tfrizzell"," This Show Will Be Used to Study How Life Was 100 Years From Now","","21 July 2001","Brilliant television series that could probably be best described as ""The Flintstones"" gone stark-raving mad. ""The Simpsons"", everyone knows them. Some love the series and some could care less about it. Love it or hate it, it is near impossible to criticize the intelligence and creativity of this series. The titled animated family makes their home in Springfield, USA and gets into situations that are seemingly more outlandish and crazier than the previous adventure. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are still going strong after nearly a dozen years of television life and with each passing moment it seems that the series sets some new precedent. For several years the show seemed to be the only attraction to the then obscure Fox Network. It was the first primetime animated show that was treated like a sitcom since ""The Flintstones"" quietly left the air in 1966. Many people feared the series when it first premiered in 1989 because they felt that it was hardcore adult material in a candied form that would appeal to younger audiences. Well for the most part this was true. However, ""The Simpsons"" would prove to be much more for all audiences. The great thing about the series is that it caters to all audiences. True there are usually situations that may not be suitable for all viewers, but then again that is true with everything on television this side of Disney Land and Sesame Street. ""The Simpsons"" works because of great comedy of course, but also great lessons that can be taken from most of the episodes. The people within the program may be animated, but they are just as complicated and vulnerable as the people watching them. All the regulars have their quirks, but in some episodes you can understand what certain characters are going through because the show is so life-like at times. Former President George Bush (the one from 1988-1992) once made a statement that families should be more like ""The Waltons"" and less like ""The Simpsons"". His opinion is somewhat old-fashioned and unrealistic. In other words, many topics dealt with in ""The Simpsons"" fit life for people in the 1990s and 2000s better than ""The Waltons"" did in the 1970s. A crowning achievement in television art. 5 stars out of 5."
"228","Smells_Like_Cheese"," Probably the best television show on Earth","9/10","12 November 2003","The Simpsons is the longest running animated TV series since The Flinstones, and you could understand why after watching just one of the Simpsons episodes. Simply because The Simpsons is just so hilarious and incredibly clever and has been ripped off so many times, but nothing has come close to the brilliance that the Simpsons writers have brought us.We have Homer Simpson, one of the most beloved TV characters of all time, with his famous quote ""Doh!"". He's an overweight, lazy, and not the brightest bulb, but so incredibly lovable for the fact of how bipolar he is! One minute he can be so incredibly depressed, but the next minute really happy and giggling. My favorite Homer quote is when he kills the zombie Ned Flanders in a Halloween episode, Bart tells him ""Dad! You killed the zombie Flanders!""... ""He was a zombie?"" Marge is Homer's wife and a homemaker. She is at times naggy, but always manages to get in some terrific humor and some deep sympathy with all she puts up with. My favorite Marge quote is ""Bart, don't make fun of grad students. They've just made a terrible life choice."" Bart is the oldest son and a rebel. His usual quotes are ""Don't have a cow"" ""Cool, man!"" ""Ei Carumba!"". He's this generation's Dennis the Menace. My favorite Bart quote is ""I need a soul, Ralph, any, your's!"", you'll see what I mean.Lisa is the second oldest and the smartie pants of the Simpson clan, she's kind of the know it all who solves all the adventures of the Simpsons. My favorite Lisa quote is ""They're only using you for your pool you know... shut up brain! I have friends now, I don't need you any more!"". Last, but not least, Maggie, the eternal baby of Homer and Marge, always a great love of the screen, but no famous quotes, just memorable moments like when she turns into an alien.The supporting cast is a terrific addition, my favorites include Mr. Burns, Homer's boss, Groundskeeper Willy, the school janitor, and Mr. Skinner, the school principal. The Simpson is just a terrific show that in one way or another you will see at least one episode in your lifetime. I know that generations to come, they will still be watching The Simpsons."
"229","bob the moo"," May be suffering a bit with time  but overall this is one of the finest show to come out of America","","20 April 2002","The series that follows the dysfunctional family of the Simpsons.  The oafish Homer who can barely go a day without slacking or getting mixed up in crazy adventures. His wife, Marge, who tries to hold it all together.  His duaghter Lisa who is smarter that her gene pool should allow, Bart  every inch the classroom rebel.  The family is rounded out by the youngest  baby Maggie.  The family interact with those around them and learn lessons or sometimes fail to change completely.When this series started in 1987 as a string of rough shorts in Tracey Ulman's show it would be a brave man who would have predicted that over a decade later that this series would be as huge as it is.  However the series got launched with the Christmas special in the early 90's.  The first series saw the animation greatly improved and the characters developed fully to be more involving.  However the story lines were not as sharp or as full as they were to be.  The second series and onwards saw the Simpsons have better stories  often multi-layered stories filled with pop-culture references and background jokes that reward the careful viewerto try and list them would take ages.For an American sitcom (for that is what it is) this is amazing  the intelligence of the script is fantastic.  The depth of the stories are involving, witty and packed.  For a movie buff like me, this is a gold mine  from sly references in the background to full blow scenes almost spoofing movies this has them all. In some programmes that have background jokes the main stuff at the front often suffers or is ignored totally.  However here the main plot and dialogue is fresh and well thought out  it is amazing that for almost all of it's run The Simpsons rarely had a bad episode.True  recent shows have begun to show a slide in quality but this is to be expected after more than 10 years at the top.  However it is generally brilliant and clever.  After the first series everything improved.  Not only was the series used for political comment, satire and ironic humour (in a country that generally can't do any well) but it is also heart warming and funny.The characters live in a balance between reality and surreality.  They are sort of recognisable as real people in terms of habits and experiences  but in another way they are out there..Homer has been in Space, stopped a nuclear explosion etc.  The mix of this makes for an unique programme.  What makes it better is that the makers never draw a line between the madness and the normality  one episode is made up of a bad-neighbour type war between Homer and George Bush Snr!  The mix is seamless and adds layers to each show.The wealth of characters is another strength. The main family is strong  even Maggie has regular input and adventures!  However where most sitcoms really rely on their main subjects for the stories, The Simpsons has a supporting cast of dozens and dozens of really good characters  all of whom are able to carry an episode.  They range from the normal characters (an inept  Police Chief, an Asian shop keeper who is used to being robbed at gunpoint) to the referential or well imagined, (the well-educated Sideshow Mel, a bitter Krusty the Clown, an useless lawyer).  All the characters have become more fully used as time has gone on.The voice actors are all excellent and all do a huge range of voicesof course they get very well paid for it!  Unfortunately the late Phil Hartman provided the voices of two of my favourite characters and I really miss his dry humour and strong all-American voice.  Lionel Hutz was a great character and my favourite, Troy McClure is a wonderful spoof of 60's B-movie actor Doug McClure.  This depth really helps the show and has allowed it to feel so very fresh years on.I could go on for ever, but the series is a wonderful bit of proof that sitcoms don't have to be simple, full of canned laughter and focus on sassy teenagers!  The joys of the dialogue are backed up by movie references and crazy adventures.  The wonderful Simpson family are supported by a huge cast of imaginative characters who are always well used and a queue of celebrities just lining up to have a few minutes in the show. Quite simply this is consistently the best show to come out of American in my life time."
"230","TheLittleSongbird"," A great show, despite declining in quality over the years","7/10","8 January 2010","When I was 10, I adored the Simpsons, America's favourite dysfunctional family. Me and my brother and sisters watched it every day after school, and got a bagful of laughs. Two years ago though, I stopped watching it. Maybe I didn't find it as funny, creative or as original anymore. Well after seeing the Simpsons Movie, I decided to give the show another chance. And I am glad I did, because it is smart, creative, funny AND original. It is true that the show has been declining in written quality the past three years or so, but the more recent seasons are still watchable, thanks to the animation and the endearing characters.The show's animation is fantastic. In animated shows, I like animation that is colourful and fluid, and the animation in this show is exactly that. The theme tune is irresistibly catchy and the story lines are outstandingly good. Other than the voice acting what made the show so good was its writing. Not obnoxious or childish, but smart and most importantly funny. And the visual jokes are also impressive.And the voice acting is exceptional bringing the dysfunctional family to life. Homer is a type of father figure who repeatedly lets down his family, has a love for doughnuts and beer and pretty much hates his job. Dan Castallenetta, a talented voice actor whom I fondly remember as Megavolt from Darkwing Duck, does a great job not only as Homer but as Grandpa and Krusty, not loud and abrasive at all but just right. Julie Kavner is also great as Marge, a caring matriarch who genuinely cares for her family. Nancy Cartwright is perfect as Bart, who is quite naughty and hates school, same with Yeardley Smith as studious Lisa. Plus Maggie is absolutely adorable.Then there are the supporting characters. My favourite is Grandpa, he is absolutely hilarious. Hank Azaria is amusing as Moe and Chief Wiggum, and Harry Shearer is suitably chirpy as Ned and impresses equally with his monotonic drawls for Principal Skinner and Reverend Lovejoy. There are many memorable guest performances from various celebrities, and frequent appearances from Phil Hartmann and Tress MacNeille. My favourite is Kelsey Grammar as Sideshow Bob, a reprising villain I enjoy watching, sinister yet funny. All in all, despite the fact it isn't as enjoyable as it was, The Simpsons is still a great show. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"231","bat-5"," Pure genius","","17 January 1999","The Simpsons is a show that has sustained ten years of constant humor.  The stories have gradually become better and the second fiddle characters were getting more screen time which translates into a much more realized show. The pop culture references abound and delight those who can pick them out. My personal favorite is the Citizen Kane references in the episode called ""Rosebud.""  Plus, anything with C. Montgomery Burns is hysterical.  The guest stars aren't there as a ""special appearance"" touted by the networks. They actually work into the storyline, and that makes it all the more enjoyable.  Where else can you see The Moody Blues acting like thugs in a Vegas casino?"
"232","Rammstein-2"," A landmark in TV-show history","5/10","5 February 2001","i have yet to see something as funny, clever and entertaining as ""The Simpsons"" on TV. I'm hardly a TV-series buff, I rarely have the patience and interest to follow a show for more than five or six episodes. ""The Simpsons"" is the one show that I am very sorry to have missed out on until just a couple of years ago. Luckily, Swedish television are rerun experts. It is also the only show that I make sure to follow apart from perhaps ""Friends"", but in entertainment value, ""The Simpsons"" is way ahead.What makes this show so great is its attention to detail, its outrageous dialogue and its completely fearless way of dealing with any issue that crosses the writers' minds. The many characters and their extravaganza makes it an endless well of new angles, new ideas and even more outrageous dialogues. Another very important element is the mocking irony and sarcasm which permeates the entire series. The smarmy and cheesy moments that a great many episodes end up in are extremely clever and becomes an important part of the fun.What impresses me the most about the series is, however, the enormous amount of detail: the attentive spectator is not just in for the obvious gags - there's always something going on or something to read in the background, which makes a VCR mandatory so you can go back and check that special detail out again. Its a fantastic show, and its a great moment when one can sit down and watch another insane, stupid, disastrous and hilarious episode."
"233","liquidcelluloid-1"," Blind loyalty and network greed has ruined what used to be an animated masterpiece","","25 January 2004","Network: Fox; Genre: Animated Comedy, Parody, Satire; Content Rating: TV-PG (language, adult contend and animated nudity); Available: DVD and syndication everywhere; Perspective: Classic (star range: 1 - 5);Seasons Reviewed: Season 12+ If someone had told me 10 years ago that I would one day be bored by 'The Simpsons', I would have called them crazy. But here we are and while 'The Simpsons' has become the longest running show on TV at the cost of its core integrity. ""Simpsons"" in its prime was the best things to grace the small screen. A funny, ground-breaking animated comedy with lightening-quick wit, insightful social and brilliantly integrated parody. It created its own universe with an entire town of original characters. Most importantly, it actually helped shape the sense of humor of an entire generation. That generation which has now grown up and is now creating animated shows in direct competition. ""Simpsons"" is a pale shadow of its former greatness. It gradually slipping this way for several years, but it wasn't until the 2002 and 2003 seasons that the show really smashed up against the rocks for good. I used to delight in each new episode of ""Simpsons"". But now the show clunks along each week in what appears to be filling time. The free-wheeling gags it used to deliver with such ease are now weighted down by an unnecessary over importance on story. The show at its best may get off a funny, sharp one-liner every now and then. It's biggest asset currently is it's willingness and given latitude to slam its own network. I do delight in their ""Joe Millionaire"" on-air promo parodies or a recent episode where Homer calls to give the network an idea and the recording says something like ""If you know of another network's reality show we can rip off, press 2..."" So what happened? There really is no one thing that can easily be pointed out to all the late-commers and say ""this is what happened"" - you have to have traced the history. The 'jump the shark' moment could have come as early as the infamous Frank Grimes episode where our vision of The Simpson family was suddenly turned into something to aspire to instead of parody. It could be the legion of big name celebrities forced into every episode. To bring down a show as great as this, it was a slow convergence of several things. Watching it, 3 differences are evident on-screen at any given time: First, the stripping down most of the characters to 1-note cartoons. Notably, British favorite Homer Simpson going from child-like, hard-luck father to a rag-doll for wild animals to rip apart as each episode closes. I'm particularly appalled at its attempts to use Homer as a political mouthpiece. Did you know that a guy who once lit a Q-tip so he could see inside his brain has an active concern for global politics? Yeah, I didn't either. Secondly, the classic Baby Boomer voice of the series has evaporated and was replaced with contemporary generation X and Y jokes. Now, it's the internet and Tony Hawke. The voice of the series used to be one of creator Matt Groening's, seen through the eyes of Homer and Marge. That voice has been lost as the show has turned into an assembly line institution, repackaged and been homogenized for the masses and a new generation of writers lead by Ian Maxton-Graham has come in to ""keep it fresh"". Thirdly, it has run out of creative juice. Anyone who has stuck with the show long enough can see it literally re-telling jokes and recycle previous story lines. When the recycling becomes too obvious or the episode makes no sense, they merely double back and declare it all a big self-parody. Not even Al Jean (architect of the show in its prime and the Larry David of ""The Simpsons"") can save it now. Since the talented voice cast has remained the same low these many years, I put all the blame on this squarely with the Fox network who refused to let this show go out gracefully when Groening siphoned off his role to work on his dream project, the now far superior 'Futurama'. In Fox's race to claim this endurance record they have turned a once edgy and visionary show into an institution with an assembly line production and revolving door of writers to match any of the other lame shows on TV. Behind the scenes, maybe the condescending we-can-do-no-wrong attitude of Maxton-Graham has dealt the show its biggest death blow, while producer Mike Scully sat back and ineptly let Maxton-Graham run it into the ground. In the end, the biggest blame may actually land with the ""die-hard fans"" that embolden the show by letting it get away with this junk. Yes, ""The Simpsons"" was ground-breaking and every adult animation in the future owns it a bit of gratitude, but blind loyalty to a show only for how it performed in the past isn't healthy. Since it has hit long-running status the critical bandwagon jumping has begun and ""Simpsons"" is more popular than ever amongst critics that want to be on the inside of history. We've now reached a point where the bad episodes and bad entire seasons outweigh the good and that, I'm afraid, is going to be the sad legacy of ""Simpsons"" . A train-wreck of crass, childish humor, grainy animation, oddly misplaced satire and forced parodies of only the most obvious pop culture targets. 10 years ago I didn't know what I would do without ""The Simpsons"" but now, particularly with the emergence of satisfying new adult animated shows ('Futurama', 'Family Guy' and 'South Park'), living without it might be pretty good. * * / 5"

"235","mercer74"," The greatest television show of all time","","5 June 1999","What more can I possibly say about a TV show that has already been praised to death?  I was 15 when the Simpsons first aired and I'm 25 now.  I've seen every single episode, and I'd have to say it's a rare combination of factors that come together to make The Simpsons the best show ever.It's a very clever and intelligent show - they never dumb anything down - and as creator Matt Groening has remarked, ""The Simpsons is a show that rewards paying attention.""  There are always enough obscure pop-culture references or subtle background gags to ensure that the second, third, or tenth viewing of an episode will find you noticing something you hadn't before.In the early days of The Simpsons, they derived a large part of their popularity from the everyday, down-to-earth, unglamorous, average-blue-collar-slob aspect of the Simpson family.  Homer is lazy and doesn't like his job, Bart doesn't excel at school, the plastic ketchup bottle they use at the dinner table makes that farting sound, and so on. This aspect of the program contrasts it with popular 80's family sitcoms such as The Cosby Show which always featured impossibly well-functioning families who got along a little too perfectly and usually learned a neat little lesson at the end of each episode.  An early tag-line for The Simpsons said that they ""put the Fun back in Dysfunctional.""Perhaps this blue-collar-slobness by itself is nothing shockingly original - think of previous TV shows such as Roseanne, Married with Children, All in the Family, The Honeymooners - but the Simpsons doesn't stop there.  This show is extremely densely packed with jokes - everything from cerebral witticisms and sly satire to Homer falling down and going ""D'oh!""  Because it's a cartoon, the writers can get away with surreal gags such as the time Homer tells a joke which falls flat, after which a long silence happens which is punctuated by a single tumbleweed rolling through the Simpson's living room.There are just too many things to mention about The Simpsons.  It can be touching occasionally; more often the viewers are treated to an unequalled cavalcade of obscure references, surreal sight gags, wacky adventures, self-mocking irony...   The list goes on and on.  Just watch it, else you're missing out on one of the most important elements of 1990's popular culture."
"236","fjk1138-731-161881"," How the mighty have fallen","9/10","9 December 2020","The Simpsons was my de facto go-to comedy from 1992 until the movie came out. Based on other reviews here, it appears that I hung in a lot longer than most. But I gave up eventually.From 1992 until 2007 I used to record, save, and constantly re-watch the Simpsons on VHS. Once the DVDs started coming out, I would buy every single box set and watch those to death as well. I used to drive my friends nuts with quoting lines or referring to episodes. I looked forward to every episode, what new disaster Homer could get into, and what goofy plot they would come up next. I loved every diverse and wacky character and how they all interacted with each other, good or bad. The writing was top notch, the parody of real-life things was great, and voice acting was flat-out superb. From the time I started watching until the early 2000's, it was heavenly. From 2002 - 2006, it started showing some signs of weakening, but still managed to make me laugh.Then the movie came out in 2007.It had a few moments (Marge's choice words about the bomb got my one ""out loud"" laugh), but it felt lackluster and pandered to a generic audience instead of staying really true to the diehards that were with the show since the beginning. The movie also marked the start of the show eventually going to CG versus traditional animation.And here is where things start changing. Eventually, the writing went from meh (and later super-meh) to flat out lazy and about as funny as a terminal disease. Since CG animation no-doubt faster to produce than hand-drawn, the Simpsons went from feeling hand-made to mass-produced. This effect eventually seemed to spill over into all aspects of the show. Despite this, I was willing stick it out so long as it made me laugh, but it stopped doing that and I just couldn't bear to watch any longer. For me, it was really like a dear friend or relative was dying before my very eyes, albeit slowly and painfully.But what really buried it for me was when that loser and complete no-talent ""comedian"" Hari Kondabolu cried and whined that Apu was somehow an insult to the entire Indian race (a farcical cartoon character, really?) which eventually stopped Hank Azaria from voicing it. Congrats Hari, you ruined one of my favorite characters on the show. What is it that you are known for again? Oh right, we're still waiting for all the brilliant comedy that you have yet to produce. It appears that Hank will no longer be voicing Carl either, who is now replaced by a ""correctly-raced"" actor. Because, you know, the earth was going to explode or something if that wasn't done. I supposed it's just a matter of time until Dr. Nick Riviera will be saying ""Bye Everybody!"" as well.But it's OK, I've reached the level of acceptance and abandoned the show several years ago. I honestly don't know anyone who still watches this show either, but for those that still do I would ask that you please stop. Let the viewership die so that the show can die right along with it. It really needs to be put out its misery at this point. Every once in a while, I catch a glimpse of recent episodes when switching channels and most of the voice actors sound tired. I'm sure this is easy money for them by now, but really, I would think they are all talented enough to do other voice work in many other places. Or not - maybe they all need to retire. Poor Julie Kavner's voice sounds like it's practically gone now.There was a time when I used to hope the state that Springfield is in would be revealed in the final episode, but now? I couldn't care less. What once was a show that screwed with the established order eventually got swallowed up by it and drowned in a sea of political correctness. I sold off my Simpsons box sets years ago and moved on to other things. The classic version of the show still exists for me now, but only in my memories. It's a world where Apu does not want anyone offering Ganesha a peanut, but he does ask us to ""Come again!""."
"237","Atreyu_II"," No longer that great","","14 August 2007","When the animated TV series ""The Simpsons"" first came out, nobody could image how successful it would become. But they made this a clever TV series: that original family with their silly humor conquered many people. From 1989 until (maybe) almost the end of the 1990's, this was a great TV show. It was very humorous, highly creative and had all the needed ingredients to be a classic.All of the characters are very peculiar and eccentric: Bart, Lisa, Marge and Homer. On the other hand, Maggie is innocent because she's a baby. Marge has that weird hair and Homer is more than just the silliest of all Simpsons: he's the silliest ""family chief"" ever!However, in these last years ""The Simpsons"" has been notoriously going downhill. It isn't that great anymore. It doesn't have that classic status any longer and its humor has become more irritating. It isn't so funny anymore.Now is definitely time to put an end to this TV show. They should have done that years ago. The more time they'll take to finally do it, the more they'll ruin it."
"238","gillmurphydogg"," Iconic but....","6/10","1 January 2023","The Simpsons is a world treasure but I feel the series has gone on for far too long. Gone are the days of universal innocent jokes that happened in the earlier seasons up to 13. I'm thinking of iconic episodes where they all get separated on a camping trip. Or where they go to Australia. Or where they adopt dear old Apu. Now the latter episodes seem focused on current events making them less relatable to a wider audience.Overall though, I must say, this is a series that will remain unforgettable and the long-running work of the writers, voice actors, directors and animators is to be commended as their legacy will live on. 7/10."
"239","Arlando909"," It started off fantastic...","","1 June 2006","No one, not even Matt Groening himself, could've imagined that The Simpsons would become as big as it did. Nor could anyone anticipate it could become so cultural. ""D'oh"" is in the dictionary, and it has spawned off several catch-phrases and one liners. Truly, The Simpsons is the biggest thing since Seinfeld! The first three seasons showed them as if they were an actual family. Like the kind of family you'd meet on the street (only a lot more dysfunctional). Homer trying to do the fatherly thing in each episode. Marge being the voice of reason all the time. Lisa and Bart with their sibling rivalry. These first three seasons are not usually sighted as being the best, but they are often brought up when one speaks of ""The Best Episode Ever!"" By Season four, the show took a turn for what may have been the best. It left it's more realistic roots and became more of a satire. With more zany antics and more clever, witty, and often times sophisticated humor, The Simpsons became the most popular family on television. Each episode still contained it's own merits, themes and messages. Seasons 4 to about 10 are often said to be the ""Golden Age"" of The Simpsons.However, as the year 2000 came, fans began to see themselves divided. Those who stuck with the show since it came about in 1989 were quick to jump on how the show changed. The humor became more lurid and toilet like, with antics becoming heavily more unrealistic and zany (to the point where some even say it isn't funny... but stupid). Some characters becoming unrealistically stupid, and the show shifting gears from focusing on Bart to Homer... to everyone outside of the Simpson family. The show also began to see more cumbersome and meaningless plots. Plots that didn't focus on current issues, or that didn't seem to be as strong as older episodes. Despite this, new fans seem to have come about to replace then, and the show continues to remain at the top of its game, even today.I'm sure you all know where I stand on that debate. Nine stars to nine fantastic seasons."

Not for me. I don't watch it anymore."
"241","skinnygaillard"," Time to pull the trigger...","","25 November 2021","The show had an excellent start, and was great for many seasons. Simply put, it was iconic, quotable, and universally loved, as the show combined humour and meaning well.Some watchers argue that the show went downhill, rapidly after about the 10th, though I'd say that there were plenty of funny episodes right up to the late teens. While there were a few good moments in the 20s, this is when The Simpsons lost its charm. It went from a timeless, quirky show to something that we need a lot less of: a jumble of pandering and meaningless drivel. It tries too hard to be hip and it's a real shame to see voice actors go after so-called 'controversy' and a few, ignorant demands.The show just isn't what it used to be. It is no longer satisfying or funny, and it's time it was cancelled."

"243","amarkovic-65487"," I'm glad I'm not the only one...","","13 April 2020","I was hesitant to give this the rating I did, but from reading other audience reviews, my review actually will come across as far more... lenient. What can I say that hasn't been said already, the golden age of The Simpsons (seasons 3-8) is flawless television. Going through it again, it was awe inspiring to me how they manage to structure joke upon joke upon joke upon joke, something that must've been a complete breath of fresh air considering the boring, lifeless, milk-toast excuses for comedy shows that were coming around at that time. Yeah, those ones using canned laughter which relied completely on actors and people being loud as an excuse to be funny with a roaring laughter every 5 seconds spoon feeding the audience of when to laugh, with an exception of Seinfeld these were just boring shows for boring people, The Simpsons was intelligent, heart felt, structured and most of all... FUNNY.However, all good things must come to an end. In an ideal scenario, The Simpsons ended on season 10 and season 9 didn't include the infamous 'The Principal and The Pauper', it lives its legacy as one of the greatest TV shows of all time and is passed down from generation to generation. Sure, the season 9 and 10 weren't golden age material, they were still solid entries in The Simpsons canon but then from season 11, things started to drastically change, we were getting episodes which would've been some of the weaker episodes in a golden age era season that were the best episodes of the season they were actually in. Sure, season 13 was pretty good but the show was tanking in quality almost directly after, pretty much season 14 onwards was terrible (not to mention the really bland movie). Now we're on the 31st season, the show is just completely unwatchable, the best episodes are mediocre and boring and the worst episodes are... 'Lisa Goes Gaga' (if you know what I mean). The show, at this point, is almost completely unrecognisable, a mere slight resemblance of what it once was (even the animation sucks nowadays), that's why it's so damn difficult to rate this show, at the same time it's one of my favourite and least favourite shows, the show should've ended 20 years ago, you can't keep lightning in a bottle for that long, it's not a show that is relevant to today's cultural landscape, it would be so much more respected if it had ended on its 10th season. That's why I can't in good conscience rate this show the 9 or 10/10 that I want to... but the only reason I'm giving it a 7 over a 5 is because even though there is more bad than good of The Simpsons (more signals for it to just end), the golden age is some of the best television to have ever been constructed and cannot be ignored.Here's how I'd rate the seasons:
Season 1 - 8/10
Season 2 - 8/10
Season 3 - 9/10
Season 4 - 9/10
Season 5 - 10/10
Season 6 - 10/10 (best season)

"244","hereispierre"," Once Great, Now Bad","8/10","7 August 2018","It's very hard for me to try to put a rating on this show. At one time it was the best comedy series on TV and possibly even the best one ever. Unfortunately it went into a decline after the first ten years or so, and then a steep decline, to the point where it is less than a shadow of what it once was. They really should have quit several years ago, but at this point they might as well just keep going and see how many episodes they can rack up before the plug is finally pulled."
"245","DongDiggity"," Serious Decline After Season 12","","1 October 2021","The Simpsons was an amazing show until after season 6 and then was still good until around season 12. It became decent after that and really went into ""meh"" territory after season 20-ish.The biggest problem with the Simpsons is that it has lost it's magic and has become all about woke and appeasing the vocal minority. Examples of this are removing Apu from the show, removing an actor from voicing a character(s) because they aren't the proper skin color, and have removed episodes/content (this isn't new but removing Stark Raving Dad is new)."
"246","bagelbiterboio"," Sorry","5/10","19 October 2021","I'm sorry but I'm pretty sure it's common knowledge by now the show has been on a decline for years now, but at this point I believe there is more bad episodes than good with a lot of meh sprinkled in. I have watched every episode of this show and will continue to watch so that title stands and I would be lying if I say I didn't enjoy myself for a portion of it. Though I'd also be lying if I wasn't very critical of this show and I didn't hate a good amount of it's episodes. All and all I feel generous giving this a positive score still (6) but this 6 is carried by how good the good is."
"247","DarthBill"," Am I the only one who thinks that this show sucks lately?","","11 August 2004","This was once one of the funniest shows on TV. Now it's just crap. It ceased to be side-splittingly funny during the 1996-1997 season, which opened with a James Bond parody episode that never quite got going, featured the divorce of Milhouse's parents, a painfully unfunny guest voice for Kelsey Grammer's TV brother David Hyde Pierce, and perhaps the only mildly funny bit: the romantic fling between Principal Skinner and Bart's teacher (can't spell her name). Now a days, the show is just one outlandishly ridiculous sight gag stacked on top of another, with no real substance or plot behind it and whatever social satire there may be getting lost in the process. Homer is really blown way out of a proportion as the latter day idiot man trying to exploit the system whenever he can or just act like a lazy bastard. Marge, Bart, and Lisa are just annoying. Some of the supporting characters have their moments but not many.The earlier seasons when the characters were more like real humans were the highpoint of the show."
"248","alyssaabernaughty"," Difficult to Rate","6/10","13 July 2017","I surprisingly had a very difficult time rating this show, but I did and a 5 out of 10 is in my opinion a fair rating when you consider the series as a whole.The reason it is so hard for me to rate this show is the simple fact that it has been on so very, very long. 621 episodes and growing, according to the numbers here on IMDb. And when a season lasts that long, it obviously will have stretches of good quality and stretches of bad quality. The Simpsons is no different.Although the series does still make me chuckle here and there, the quality has completely fallen off in the show's later years. It suffered a sudden and terrible decline and I still feel very disappointed watching it, remember and ""missing"" the fantastic episodes of old.Because that's the other extreme. When The Simpsons first went on the air, and for at least 8 seasons (to me, at least), it was one of the very best comedy shows ever produced. The characters were great, the writing was slick, it seemed like every single joke hit its mark and I laughed out loud all the time. It was one of the few ""can't miss"" shows I remember in my life, where Sundays at 8pm I just had to be home to watch it. Everyone talked about it, and regardless of how many seasons you think it lasted everyone considers those early years the ""golden age"" of the Simpsons.I'm not sure if the problem is people leaving, or naturally running out of ideas after being on the air so long, or simple laziness, or the writers and staff getting old, but clearly at a point this show just went from the creative tops to something almost awful.I'm basically averaging it out (6 years of awesomeness, 6 years of being OK, and since then being just bloody awful) to give this show a 5 out of 10. I know I'll be bashed by haters who find my rating too high, and Simpson-heads who can't believe anyone would go lower than 10, but this is the grade I think is fair for this show."

Let's face it folks the hey-day of the Simpsons was well over a decade ago. Talk about a show that just doesn't know when to stop. It aggravates me to no end to witness the desperate lengths this show goes to year after year. Every show has a shelf life people and the Simpson is way past its expiration date. I truly think that the only reason it is still on the year is force of habit. Both the public and the Fox network are so used to having on that they shutter at ending it. Trust me, It should end."
"250","bigverybadtom"," The Rolling Stones Of TV Sitcoms","6/10","23 September 2013","Originally ""The Simpsons"" were animated segments on ""The Tracy Ullman Show"" before they got their own series, which became a mega-hit. And what has made them so popular? Perhaps good timing; animated sitcoms meant for adults were a novelty at the time. Yes, the show does have some wit, and the stories are fast-paced. But even it its salad days, it wasn't as funny as all that. Basically, it's a standard sitcom idea that's been done many times before-stupid father, smart mother who puts up with everything, smart kids who really know what's going on (or so they believe), with liberal propaganda thrown in.The series still goes on, even though many viewers complain that the show went downhill by the end of the 1990's. What makes it continue? It has a cult following and still gets viewers, and FOX seems to want to milk it for all it's worth, and more. And that's why I compare ""The Simpsons"" to the Rolling Stones, a band that continues by living off its past image."
"251","generationofswine"," An Honest Review","","25 February 2019","To address the failing quality:The Simpsons once mocked and then it became mainstream pop culture. So that is a cause of why it has declined.And another cause is that there is a new PC comedy trend to laugh at things. As in the audience is expected to laugh at the object itself without having an actual joke behind it. As in, ""This is a computer, Laugh at it!""Because of that we see a transformation of the jokes. The celebrity guests were once the butt of the joke. Mulder and Scully came on and the Simpsons mocked them. Now the joke is the celebrity guest. As in, ""This is Lady Gaga,"" or ""this is Michelle Obama.""They aren't spoofed or satirized in any way, the audience is just asked to laugh at the fact that they have a celebrity guest.And the final reason is the laugh track comedy, in which the Simpsons has none. That is no laugh track. But now the writing sets up the jokes with almost a pause for laughter as if the tracks were there.In the past the jokes were piled onto one another. There would be several jokes stacked right next to one another in a single event. Now it has become joke, pause to acknowledge the joke, continue.But no ones really laughing because it's no longer mocking culture, it's no longer spoofing the celebrity guests, and it's lost virtually all of its edge."

I like how Saitama is this laid back hero but at the same time, does his best to be badass and save the world. I even like his robot companion Genos, he's also likeable too and actually kind of sweet for a tough ass looking hero himself. As well as that, he cares about Saitama and that really stands out with the show!Love the humour, the characters and its on going storyline.

(With the addition of the typical ""rival"" character, though there were a couple of interesting aspects in his backstory)My vote vote for the first season is 9/10.My vote for the second is 8/10."
"263","baumhenrik"," Epic","","27 January 2020","One Punch Man has the perfect balance between powerful planet bursting action scenes and a chilled main character that doesn't seem to bother about anything going on. The animation of the first season is top notch the way the images display the impact and speed of the fights is just mind blowing and a must watch for every animation lover.
Also there's this great humor and perfect timing that makes One Punch Man almost a parody for so many other Anime shows. When Son Goku's gotta train his butt off to defeat his enemies Saitama is already over this point. He just needs one punch to blow away whatever's standing in his way. This idea is just brilliant to me and works surprisingly well.
Watch this show you won't regret it."
"264","Alan_H4"," Blown away - Like Saitama the anime itself has no limit's to its awesomeness!","9/10","9 November 2015","I am truly tempted to give One punch man a 10 but in my opinion there is no perfection. There is near perfection and one punch man is that. The first episode that i saw, i laughed so hard that i almost fell off my chair. As it progresses to the next episodes they try to combine the comedic and the seriousness of the story together, and they manage to do that. I feel like that the writers are truly doing this with a feeling of passion and next to it they enjoy the absurd fighting sequences. Opinion on the last two episodes of season 1:My thoughts: The amount of awesomeness put in this two episodes is beyond imagination. It's just incredible how they build up the climax to the end and to show the endless powers Saitama has. Although it's a parody it doesn't stop me as a viewer to enjoy the anime and accept it as part of something great. When i say something great, i mean putting it next dragon ball, and other incredible animes. It's obvious to the rational thinker that a lot of elements like the characters design (boros etc) are similar to Dragon ball, and that it's influenced by them. BUT what makes it so different one might ask himself: Just by observing the amount of details put in to the fighting sequences will tell you that 'one punch man' is a serious anime (in some ways). Dragon ball is nostalgic and has a great history and character development behind its series and one punch man will have to gain more years in order to obtain the status DB has. What i'm trying to say is that the detail put in to the fighting scenes in one punch man are far beyond what other anime have achieved or tried to... It's a masterpiece in way... And that's what gave this anime a 9 out of 10. He destroys all of his enemies with one punch and mocks them like they were nothing. But it still does not get boring and that's the reason why this anime is a great success. Make the details look sublime and the fighting sequences beyond comprehention, mix it with a flavor of humor/comedy and you've got in my eyes the perfect anime (action fans). Just take a good look at the episode where Saitama fights Genos and you'll get the perfect picture on why this anime is amazing (there are youtube videos with that scene). It even got me to search some more info about this anime on the internet. There are youtube videos and articles about the origin of one punch man. It's interesting to take a look. I hope this show keeps up the quality as it is and i can't wait for more! ----> after watching the last two episodes i can only imagine where it is headed. This anime has proved (after this season) that it will not fail to entertain it's anime loving fans!"
"265","facecht"," One-Punch Dude","","15 November 2015","A new perspective in the Japanese Anime. No mainstream characters, not a cliché story or plot, it has a great potential in becoming even better, personally I didn't read the manga(the comic) and in my opinion this anime show is really watchable and I recommend it to everyone no parental advisory, call them even and watch it together.Saitama is very interesting character you'll never know what he is going to do next or when is he going to punch the opposer.Don't hesitate and start watch this great show you won't be disappointed, and you'll thank anyone and everyone who made you watch it."
"266","kaangunderen"," Completely Hilarious and Full of Quality","10/10","8 October 2015","One Punch Man is one of the funniest and most entertaining anime series I've ever watched in my entire life. Even though it is a newly started anime, the first episode was highly anticipated throughout the anime community, and it was definitely golden in my eyes, with high quality animations and a hilarious story line. The main character, his enemies and the life he lives is a complete mockery of other popular anime plots, both from recent and present anime's. The lines and the dialogs in the episodes are full of puns and jokes, with a satiric sense of comedy injected into them. I highly recommend that you watch this anime, as it will definitely at least bring a smile to your face, and you won't regret the time you spent to watch it."
"267","drewsterwang"," First Season Is a Masterpiece","","29 May 2019","One Punch Man is a send-up of anime series from the past that turns tired tropes on their head and breaks up the regular formula seen in series such as Dragonball Z. The main character, Saitama, doesn't have to struggle, level up, or learn new special attacks to defeat the villains over dozens of episodes. His difficulties are mainly interpersonal and societal as he tries to fit into a world of over-the-top heroes and monsters while remaining hilariously deadpan and clueless in contrast. Highlights are not the fights and monsters, but the depiction of bureaucracy and boring details of everyday life that Saitama goes through. Season 1. 10/10.Season 2 (8 episodes in so far) is becoming what it used to satirize. We see far less of Saitama and focus shifts to an extremely powerful monster association and the pantheon of heroes fighting agains unbeatable odds to stop them. Saitama is conveniently removed from the action by way of a banal martial arts tournament with his only gag being that he has to keep a wig on his head while fighting. The fights surrounding the bloated cast have become front and center, robbing the series of its originality. Season 2 (so far) 5/10. It would be far funnier to see Saitama dealing with having a fan club than watching dozens of heroes engage in predictable monster fights."
"268","Thomas_sharma"," A sparkle of sure brilliance","9/10","25 October 2015","This series has blown me away within the first 3 episodes, it's hilarious, the action is great, the characters are interesting and not to mention its original design. The main thing that i love about this Anime is the potential it has to be something amazing due to the Manga being so excellently written. Its been a long time since i've seen an Anime that has peaked my interest so much, if you are a fan of Anime you will not be disappointed! Saitama (the main protagonist) is hilarious. Anime seems to have peaked recently due to the standard being set by shows such as Attack on Titan and I believe this show will set a new standard for Animes similar to its genre."
"269","mhorg2018"," Absolutely Hysterical!","","8 May 2018","One of the best superhero satires ever made, One Punch Man is, basically, the story of a guy who wills himself to become the most powerful hero of all time. I've only seen the first season, and I hope to see more. One Punch spends most of his time bored - as few if any can survive one of his blows. My second favorite character is the short tempered green haired telekinetic heroine, Tornado. This really has to be watched because it is so damn funny."
"270","coles_notes"," Great","9/10","25 July 2022","Based on the manga of the same name created by One, One-Punch Man follows Saitama, a super hero whose incredible strength allows him to defeat all enemies in a single punch. Definitely a farce of the entire anime superhero / fighting genre, the plot lines and humour are superb for what it is, if you're already a fan of these style fighter anime then you should find this quite funny. Netflix is currently carrying the first season, but you'll need Tubi or another service to get the latest season 2 which I just finished up. Unfortunately a new director and animation studio took over for the second season, and while its still quite good, it doesn't near live up to the quality of the first. The first season of One-Punch Man is in my opinion some of the highest quality animation in the last decade, and I could not recommend it more."
"271","gav_c"," Hilariously good","","6 July 2019","I had to watch this with me living in Japan and everyone mentioning wanpanman. From the start I found it hilarious with Saitama deadpan attitude on everything and how bored he his on fighting like it's an inconvenience. I'm not a massive fan of anime but this is good. I recommend it to everyone."
"272","newindex"," Interesting Plot. Likable Characters. Amazing Animation!","10/10","5 November 2015","One Punch Man follows a hero that can end all of his fights with one punch, and that makes him so frustrated. Now you might be thinking, what's so interesting about that? Don't you want to see the hero struggling to kill his enemy? Well not this time. Here, you will see a super-overpowered hero struggling to find a stronger enemy, struggling to feel the thrill and adrenaline of the fights he once felt when he was weak. Was his training to become strong not worth it after all?This anime is so random so the plot is unpredictable, in good ways. The animation and the fight scenes are SUPERB! It has the best fight scenes I have ever seen in all of the animes I have ever watched. Go ahead and watch it! It will be worth your time."
"273","James_096"," Just AWESOME!!!","","9 November 2015","I'd never heard of this manga..So,when I saw the anime getting rave reviews,I decided to give it a shot...Trust me,One Punch Man did not disappoint.OPM tells about the life of Saitama,a guy who can defeat enemies with just one punch,OPM acts as a parody of sorts to the endless amounts of shonen action anime that Japan produces(u know,DBZ,Naruto and the like).The anime is just comic gold with Saitama frustrated that no enemy is of his caliber(Again,a parody of the classic shonen trope).Where other series show the hero training to his peak,the guy's already at his peak..The anime is just comic gold with Saitama's expressions being the best part of it and just because it's a parody doesn't mean the action is crappy...It's the opposite actually...OPM has the best fights I've seen in ages...All in all,You should definitely watch OPM!!"
"274","simone-email"," First episode and I already love it","7/10","20 October 2015","I saw this anime online once and I finally took the time to watch it. Needless to say, the first few episodes are none less than EXCELLENT! It's action packed, funny, has just the right amount of hot people for the classic anime needs. As soon as I watched the first episode I found myself watching all of them and telling all my friends to watch it; it's so amazing, something to be put to the top, next to Death Note or Fullmetal Alchemist, or Dragon Ball Z. Definitely my favorite anime currently. There's not that much to say except that it's definitely a comedy, you'll definitely laugh or have a good chuckle. It is very gory however, not that suitable for younger anime fans. Though if you've watched Neon Genesis Evangelion or Future Diary, this show is most likely in your range of comfort and you'll most likely enjoy this anime as much as I have. Again, great anime so far."
"275","eerdem92"," Definitely a must-watch anime","","11 November 2015","I didn't know about the anime when its manga existed but many people told me that ""this thing is brilliant you gotta read it"" and I was like ""meh"" and didn't bother much. However, recently I saw that the show is being animated and 6 episodes were released and I just wanted to give it a shot. And I was like.. Boom! Absolutely blown away with the first episode and watched all 6 episodes without a break and I can say this is currently the best anime out there you can watch. The story is about a bald superhero defeating every bad-ass enemy in his way with a single blow. The animation is spectacular(better than any anime made IMO), the jokes and puns are hilarious, most importantly the plot and pacing of the story is so fast and there are definitely zero windy/exaggerated moments scenes. So, every tiny bit of second you watch has a value and NEVER boring since they packed 22 manga episodes into 6 anime episodes so far. I watched over a hundred anime but this is the first one making me impatiently wait for Sundays. Just go and watch it, NOW!"
"276","seige-hound"," One of the best action shows since Avatar, period","10/10","2 December 2015","I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of anime. I love Studio Ghibli and Mamuro Hosoda's stuff, and I enjoyed Sword Art Online enough (even though it's really flawed) and Clannad is my favourite romance show, but beyond that, I find Anime really hard to get into.Not One-Punch Man. This show is incredible.First the opening. This opening doesn't get old. We got this fantastic Power Metal theme song, paired up with some incredible stills. There's not too much animation in the opening actually, but the way the monsters are framed against the hero shows how powerful Saitama really is.So the main crux of the story follows Saitama. He's kinda bored with life at the beginning because he's too powerful. In the first episode, he defeats a massive giant with a single punch, and every other monster he faces meets a similar fate. You'd think that would make the show boring, since there's no real threat to his life, but the creators of the show found a way out of that problem by introducing a large and diverse cast of side characters.The quality of animation is impressive, with expressive comedy matched up with some amazing fight choreography. I'm reminded of the better parts of Man of Steel when I watch the fight scenes. There are moments where the fights are paused for characters to spout exposition, but they're not too frequent, and they're well done enough to ignore.I feel the one minor flaw, that may be remedied later in the show, is that there is a lack of emotional pull. I get that this is more of a Shonen show, and that the action is the main focus, but I would appreciate a little more heart to match with the flair. An example I think of would be Avatar, but this is a minor complaint that doesn't necessarily need to be fixed in order to make this show great.Overall, I'm glad I got into this, and I hope that the show continues to improve as it goes along."
"277","vipul_chaturvedi"," Imagine Deadpool, but manga version","","22 September 2021","Imagine Deadpool, but manga version. The de facto superhero parody series of this decade. Brilliant, impressive, and hilarious in every respect. For a series all about an overpowered protagonist, it got my heart pumping and emotionally invested. Also, Tatsumaki is a loli goddess."
"278","lucasdenomme"," One Punch Man a must watch","10/10","19 October 2015","This anime which has released a few weeks ago is a masterpiece created by renown anime producer, Madhouse. It sat ires classical anime genre making it an extremely hilarious show which will bring many grins to those who have already watch other anime.Perhaps the most notable accomplishment of this anime so far is the main hero Saitama who through his plain bald appearance makes us rejoice as he reveals tiny fractions of his power against formidable foes. Combine this with an epic soundtrack, amazingly drawn fight scenes and the badassery that it Saitama you get yourself an awesome anime."
"279","killakan-03899"," Review","","11 November 2015","This show is one of the best shows I've seen in the anime section. This is a personal opinion but let me tell you why I have it. This show is different than most mainstream anime, it is unique and funny, it will make you laugh every single episode and you will not get bored of it. Moreover, it brings a different type of storyline plus there are next to no anime clichés. The show is smoothly animated and the voice acting is great, at least in my opinion. I have read the manga (aka the comic) and I know what the whole show is about. There will be many more episodes to come if they plan on following the manga. I would recommend this show to every person of every age. The only reason why I wanted to give it 9/10 initially is because the episodes are pretty short. Besides that, it's amazing, a must watch."
"280","dwarves-36003"," Best. Anime. Ever.","8/10","2 February 2016","When I first heard of One Punch Man, I was skeptical of its premise. But after watching the first episode, I was immediately hooked! I've never seen a show that blends action and comedy so well! The music is great and the characters are very well drawn and acted out.It may only have English subtitles and only has twelve episodes, I still am enthralled. I also heard that the release date for the second season is sometime late this year, so I don't have to go through another Attack on Titan black hole thing again.If you are new to anime or even manga, One Punch Man is the right show for you."
"281","ashoksrinivasan"," Reasons to watch OPM","","2 January 2016","One Punch Man revolves around a guy named Saitama, who gains a power to kill any enemy with ONE PUNCH. Sounds boring? Believe me, I had the same view about that, but it changed.So, what makes OPM watchable and one of the best? 1) ANIMATION: Madhouse worked their a*s off to make it exactly same as the Manga(which, if you see, is EXTREMELY detailed), with not a big budget.2) STORY: Many critics say that OPM has no storyline, and it's just there to create a parody on mainstream anime like Dragon Ball z, One Piece etc. That's not true, at all. OPM has a very interesting storyline(One of the best, to be honest)3) COMEDY ELEMENTS: OPM is full of comedy elements, and it has many elements of satire and puns. It makes complete joke out of anime like Dragon Ball Z(a)where the battle take place in 20-30 episodes; b) Where in between the battle, the protagonist talks to the enemy for almost half the duration of the anime). Saitama believes in getting sh*t done, without talking about it.4) CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: The season one of the anime, didn't show much of the character development, and it kept in a mystery on how exactly, Saitama gained power. Although, he tells his secret work out, which obviously is unbelievable. This gives a curiosity for the watchers. Saitama is just a guy, who is hero for fun. The real character development would be of other characters like Genos.OVERALL: A must watch. :) 10/10 for sure."
"282","Big_Chez"," Honestly Amazing","9/10","30 November 2022","When I thought of One Punch Man I thought that it was just a spoof show making fun of other anime. However, after giving it a chance I came around to find out I was very wrong. This show is amazing, definitely a top 5 anime for me. It's funny, action-packed, and you will always be on the edge of your seat. Saitama is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen, the fight scenes make this show perfect. Some may find this show un-interesting because of how powerful he is, and this may be true. I think the underlying goal of Saitama's character is that he is ultimately trying to find someone strong enough to give him a challenge. I think this show is an example of ""you'll either love it or hate it."" Give it a try I promise you, you'll be hooked in an instant."
"283","onezu"," Great Anime, But Greater Manga","","14 October 2015","Personally this is my favorite anime of Fall. A must watch animeI can't wait for that ""Prophecy"" fight in the future. I really hope Madhouse gets to it.(Update - Yup Madhouse get it right!!! Yes! Yes!Yes!) Madhouse has done justice to this anime by following 100% from manga.. The fighting is awesome, the art is good and the soundtrack is superb..!!! For me personally I would say the art was better in manga, however it is understandable since putting it into animation it selves required a lot of workforce. Great job Madhouse.!! I am surely gonna get the set of DVD's and Bluray as my collection."
"284","way2smart"," One Punch Man (OPM) will knock your socks off!","10/10","28 December 2015","Let me start by saying that I never skipped the opening song of OPM. The opening (albeit somewhat cheesy) fitted this over-the-top and outrageously cool anime really well. My scouter was reading hype levels of over 9000 when the ""Hero"" opening kicked in (or punched in?).Studio Madhouse pulled out all their stops when animating this 12-episode wonder.Protagonist Saitama is a hero for fun, an ordinary human who managed to acquire extraordinary strength. Hero Saitama's strength corresponds to the titular ""One Punch Man"" as he effortlessly beats monstrous opponents to pulp with a single punch. This anime is a satire of superheroes and the whole idea of heroes beating stronger villains effortlessly each time (it takes this premise to an absurd level). Saitama is already (presumably) at the pinnacle of his strength. He gets disappointed each time that no opponent lives up to his power. Normally, formulaic battle anime focus on a protagonist who trains religiously to obtain new powers and skills in order to keep up with a rival while beating powerful enemies. However, OPM does not follow the norm.Surprisingly this anime stills grabs our attention despite us knowing that the protagonist is absurdly strong from the very beginning and that he will probably never lose a fight. This anime manages to captivate us with this rather plain hero (he is bald and possesses no fancy attacks). With the arrival of Genos (a cyborg hero who is very flashy), the simplicity of hero Saitama becomes apparent. Genos's repertoire of attacks, masculine appearance and seriousness can be juxtaposed to Saitama's plain combat skills, low-key appearance and nonchalant attitude. Interestingly, while Saitama's physical hero feats are commendable and absolutely insane, it is his virtues that makes him a hero in every sense. Saitama does not care that he is being labelled as a fake (lambasted by society); he is also prepared to relinquish his own worth to preserve the value of other heroes. The relationship between Saitama, Genos and the Hero Association is also very interesting.Give this 12-episode anime a watch. Watch at least 3 episodes before writing this off as this: ""Oh... This egg-headed guy just beat an alien with one punch. Where is the climax? This is stupid. Does this show even have a premise?""The anime stays true to the manga and is full of vibrant colours, explosions, sonic booms, etc. The animation is eye candy. The whole concept is just fresh.OPM has already spawned debates like Saitama versus Goku or Superman, and it has engaged the interest of superhero lovers. The final fight in OPM was fantastic. Saitama will be talked about for a very long time. And as I am writing this, I am listening to OPM's intro."
"285","alansabljakovic-39044"," So far so good","","22 February 2019","It is really entertaining and funny but it really doesn't have any story. I feel like every episode could be standalone. Animation is great and charachters are funny. And ending theme song is amazing."

This worldwide phenomenon has been one of the most talked about shows since it came out back in 2016 and for good reason...it's terrific! It's an absolute blast to watch and will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. This has everything a show needs to be great...action, comedy, drama, suspense, even nostalgia with this show. You really come to care for these characters and what happens to them. Obviously, season 1 was the best but the others are not far off. All are absolutely worth watching and I can't wait for the new season! Season 5 of s going to be its last so hopefully it goes out as good as it started. I can't wait!"
"312","DiCaprioFan1"," One of the best supernatural shows ever","9/10","11 March 2023","Stranger Things is absolutely as good as everyone says it is. When a show is as talked about about as much as this one has been it's hard to live up to expectations. Stranger Things has not only met those expectations but has surpassed them in every way. This is the show that our Netflix on the map as far as original shows go as this was not only one of their first but their biggest. As much as I love this show it's probably time for it for end and it is. This upcoming season is going to be the last. We have literally watched this cast grow up, they were children when this show first started and now they're all in their 20's. I can't wait for this last season and going to miss it when it's gone!"
"313","planktonrules"," Strange, that's for sure...but also very, very good.","","23 November 2016","""Stranger Things"" is a very big surprise. After all, it's a made for Netflix series, so it's going to be cheap and suck...right?! Well, no...fortunately. Despite having mostly no-name actors and a modest budget, this show turned out to be a hit and one that promises to bring us more episodes. At the time I am writing this, the eighth episode has been aired and the series appears over...or so you think until the very end.So what is this show? Well, in many ways it's like some Steven King novels (particularly ""Firestarter""), the 1980s and ""Gravity Falls"" all mashed up into one really strange but fascinating show.The show begins with a child being lost into another dimension and his mother is naturally out of her mind with worry. But soon this sense of panic is felt by many in this small community. In the midst of this, a young girl, who is simply named '11' arrives in the town and is hidden by some middle school boys. They know she's being hunted...but what does she have to do with the disappearance as well as folks seeing monsters?! Well, watch this paranoid show and you'll see.So why was the show so effective and why are so many folks eagerly awaiting more episodes? Well, the writing is terrific and the direction really keeps you on the edge of your seats. The acting is also surprisingly good and overall the package is well worth seeing and will impress you. Far better than network television."
"314","Sleepin_Dragon"," Never judge a book by its cover.","9/10","9 January 2018","I am one of those people that was put of by the thought that this was a kid's drama, from the advertising you'd swear this was aimed at a 4 o'clock after school transmission time, the reality is far from that. It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made. I utterly love the music, it is so fitting, takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. Quality in both season one and two, I like the build up and tension that is abundant in the first. It's like the Goonies meets The Quatermass Experiment."
"315","cherold"," Captures that '80s magic","","22 July 2016","There is no reason, in terms of story, for Stranger Things to take place in the '80s. But the '80s atmosphere - the dial phones, the chain smoking, Winona Ryder - are there to clue you in on the inspiration for this movie, which is pretty much every supernatural movie from the 80s with a focus on kids. E.T., Poltergeist, that sort of thing.The wondrous thing is how dead-on this tribute. It's not just the clothes and hair, but the style of acting, the scripting approach, the structure, all hold true to their inspiration. You've got the young nerdy kids, the horny, unsure teenagers, the monster, the mysterious one with the power, the bad science/government people, the conflicted investigator, the tearful mom.You could argue that this entire season is simply a pastiche made up of recycled elements, and I wouldn't disagree, but it really feels less like a copy and more like something of that era, as though the writers had fallen into a coma in 1985, woke up and got to working.While it doesn't have the high style of the Spielberg films that are a primary influence, it does have the likability. The story is consistently engaging and fun, the acting is excellent, and the movie has sufficient laughs and tears to satisfy."
"316","EVON1TY"," Gets even Stranger in every season!","10/10","13 March 2023","I wasn't expecting this nostalgic TV show could be this good. In my opinion technical details in first season was not that charming but not only storyline that gets stranger, also all the technical details getting stranger.I know first three seasons were quite the same in some ways. But the Season Four explains that situations. Not all minor things, but explains the major questions.There is some great references to The Thing, E. T., D&D, Middle-earth and even more. That references makes ithe TV Show more exciting. Especially for geeks.Film Editing was perfect even from the first season.Cinematography, VFX and Sound is got better in the second season. They were a bit weak at first season.Makeup, Costume Design, Scores, Art Direction & Set Decoration were quite good from the first season, they get a bit better along the seasons."
"317","gogoschka-1"," A nostalgic callback to the stories from my youth - but also a beautifully shot supernatural tale with charming performances and great production values","","23 January 2018","There were two dominating forces in the eighties that had a lasting effect on my cinematic taste for ever after and also resulted in my undying love for fantasy, sci-fi and horror stories: Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. I guess it isn't an overstatement to say ""The Two Steves"" probably influenced and shaped the imagination - the dreams AND the nightmares - of an entire generation.The main factor why I loved their movies and books was that kids roughly my own age figured so prominently in many of them. King wrote 'Firestarter', 'It' and 'Stand By Me', and Spielberg either directed or produced (via his company Amblin) 'E.T.', 'The Goonies' and 'Gremlins'. Those were stories where the young protagonists encountered aliens and monsters or where they themselves had supernatural powers - or where they just went on an adventure (to find a body or a long lost treasure) with grown-ups largely out of the picture. Now if you've seen 'Stranger Things', that should sound pretty familiar, right?Of course it does: because 'Stranger Things' deliberately pays homage to all those stories - and it does it very, very well. And it's not a rip-off, it's a love letter. The show emulates the themes and a certain style from those eighties treasures, and while it is a (for me) very welcome callback to some of the favorite stories from my youth, it's also very much its own thing. I won't give away the plot here (I guess you get a pretty good picture what it's about from what I wrote above), but I would like to mention that it's beautifully shot, the effects and generally the production values are top-notch, and the period-inspired music is fantastic. The biggest shout-out, however, has to go to the ensemble of actors, especially the kids who play the protagonists: their charming performances are the key to why the show works as well as it does.To sum it all up: If you're an eighties kid like me, this show is a must. For everyone else, it might depend a bit more on whether you're a genre fan or not, but if you do like supernatural stories, 'Stranger Things' is a treat. I'd rate it eight stars out of ten, but with an extra star for nostalgia, that's a 9.Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
"318","magnoliacream"," Never fails to satisfy","8/10","22 June 2022","Season after season, this always leaves me feeling amazed, exhilarated and fully satisfied. There is an element of familiarity, even cliche, about the stories involving aliens, monsters, lab experiments, orphans and family relationships, yet the way they are presented is both nostalgic and magical.It's definitely one of the best series on Netflix."
"319","FKDZ"," ST","","2 July 2022","Can't believe I never reviewed this yet, I was convinced I had. The premiere in 2016 hooked me and never let me go. The show that arguably launched streaming into the mainstream.Stranger Things is pure nostalgia magic. But saying it just does undersells pretty much every other aspect of the show. Exceptionally solid actors and characters, excellent writing, incredible score, the list goes on.As far as seasons go, season one is essentially perfect, enough mystery to want more but simple enough to be loved and enjoyed. Captured the magic of the 80s, even if you haven't lived those years. The childlike fun, it takes you right back. Season 2 and 3 try to repeat this but mostly miss out on some of the elements that made season 1, and now season 4 as well.. Horror. They both contain much more mystery and horror and that is one of the big pulls imo of this show, get you on your toes once in a while. S2-3 where focused more on fun, and went a bit too far with the whole Russian mall plot in S3.I can't overstate how good Season 4 is and feels like a comeback, back to form and for that I cannot wait to see the next season. Stranger Things has a unique hold on 80s nostalgia, a combination of fun and horror. Season 4 manages to really expand on Eleven's story and gives a ton of meaningful depth on her character. We got lot's of time with Papa and everything surrounding it. The villain was good, though his form/the way he took shape didn't impress me as much, I wished it to be more disturbing/scary looking. But it's backstory is what gives the villain strength here. Also the underlying themes of mental health are well executed and never blatantly explained or anything, maybe I'm even reading into it too much but it's definitely the vibe I got. In general season 4 showcases a more diverse set of struggles which some characters have to deal with, sexuality, communication, rejection. Just a very diverse selection with a pretty big cast by now.Eddie Munson was a fantastic addition to season 4, he grew to be one of the most likable characters in a very short while even whilst they put us on the wrong foot. The stoner friend was alright but never a comedic relief I cared too much about.Directing has been rock solid the whole series so far, every shot looks beautiful and it just hooks you in. Just fantastic and never slacks. Set design as well, it so much 80s, it's perfectly done.Combined with the directing and editing the Music is just the finishing touch to making a perfect series like this. The songs are expertly chosen and this show does not shy away from using music as much as they can. Honestly, if they'd use less the show would feel completely different. But that synth is everywhere and you will always know you are watching something in 80s. This could also get old, but hasn't for me as of yet. Music plays a huge part in this show and it just elevates so many scenes, expertly chosen.Characters, what can I say, wat is there not to like? The writing is just so good for most of them, though sometimes it leans a bit too hard into comedy/cheese but it's alright. They toned it down a lot in S4, S3 being the worst offender of poor(er) writing.S4 story wise was some of the best, the three different storylines blending into one towards the end. But also the diversity of those storylines was what kept it all so interesting and great to watch. In particular here, even though it was the worst story in S3, the Soviet storyline in S4 was my favorite of the bunch. Harbour gives another excellent performance but Gellman and Ryder also give their best. Djuricko (Yuri) and Wlaschiha (Dimitri) also very great, well written and very enjoyable.The finale of S4 was great, did it need to be a single episode with a length of two and half hours? Not really, it could've been split up in my opinion. But still it was great, though the stakes were lower in the end than I had hoped (even though that would've hurt). Though whereas other seasons didn't end on as heavy of a cliffhanger, this one did. And we know exactly what were are in for with Season 5. The final season. Regarding music, notably they used the ''When It's Cold I Like to Die.'' and my god, that's one heavy song that slapped me in the face, I've heard it before so I knew what was coming after those first few piano notes. Great choice but a gut puncher.I would have a lot more to say if I edited this review season by season but I never did until now, too late. I'm sure this series will go down as one of the big ones. Maybe it already is but it still needs to stick the landing. And I can't wait for that. But I will be sad that a show like this will be hard to replicate again. You really do get jealous of people who lived the 80s, though of course, it's romanticized here by a lot."
"320","cc0077"," I get the hype now","9/10","10 July 2022","I just finished the last episode of season 4 and that was QUITE THE EXPERIENCE, I was shocked by how long the episode was but every second of it was entertaining. Season 3 was personally my favorite because I think that season had the most comedic scenes, and it just felt very vibrant in general. I LOVED HOPPER AND JOYCE and I'm so excited to see them in future seasons as well. So excited for season 5!!"
"321","slayerjmk95"," Steven Spielberg meets Stephen King","","15 July 2016","Stranger Things is the newest foray into Netflix's original programming, of which brings us their most impressive- and strange- production to date. When a young boy named Will Byers goes missing, his friends, mother and the town are thrust into a conspiracy involving a mysterious girl named Eleven and something even more sinister hiding in the woods of Hawkins, Indiana.From the get-go, you can tell this is an homage to classic '80s Spielberg, drawing on E.T. and Close Encounters, as well as JJ Abrams' Super 8. But, as the show progresses, it becomes more and more like a twisted Stephen King story set in a Spielberg movie. It becomes a dark and twisted ride into an even darker and more disturbing world where the stakes feel higher than anything before it.I can't go into great detail because spoiling even just a bit of the story takes away from the greater mystery, but I can say, it's one of the most thrilling and intense series to be on TV, without being on TV. If it were to continue, they have to pull the same punches they did with the first season, because they took a great many clichés, and somehow made them fresh and surprising, save for just a couple that they purposefully left cliché."
"322","ahmetkozan"," Again a very nice series from Netflix!","9/10","22 April 2017","Stranger Things is a 1980s inspired and themed science fiction horror Netflix show. The show is set in November 1983 and takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins. Hawkins residence live a fairly normal life until a boy named Will Byers goes missing in the woods. Three of Wills friends Mike Wheeler (played by Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (played by Caleb McLaughin) and Dustin Henderson (played by Gaten Matarazzo) are very worried for him but what they uncover something more dark and sinister. After looking for their missing friend they come across a girl, who they call Eleven because of her tattoo. However they soon find out this isn't any ordinary girl but one with very special powers. It is very clear the show takes lot of inspiration from classics 80's films like The Goonies and ET. The performances from all of the cast are great especially the child actors, who show the right amount of charisma and banter you expect from kids growing up in the 80's. However, the star of the show here is definitely Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) who plays the ET type of role in show. Millie's brilliant acting skills have a lasting effect on the viewer even though she has 42 words throughout the whole series. The Duffer Brothers brilliant writing and directing skills play with your emotions to create a love letter to all those 80's horror films. It's truly something special! 9/10"
"323","Kevin-42"," Two very different seasons (EDIT: A few words about Season 3)","","27 October 2017","I guess plenty of people have said a lot of things about all the movie and TV references this series has and how it recreates the eighties in all their faults and splendor. I will not add to that.With the release of the second season I'd simply like to advise that both seasons are very different animals. Think of it as the difference between the original Alien movie and the Aliens sequel: Whereas the first season was more about an unknown and unseen horror and the mystery behind the backstory, the second has more in-your-face action and horror laced with character development arcs which feel nice but sometimes sidetrack the series a bit.Consequently, a fan of the show should probably watch the second season as a separate work of fiction rather than a true continuation of the first season in tone and spirit. The writers move the story forward and we get a very good piece of entertainment but the new season has to be judged on its own merits.EDIT: Season 3 turned out to be a huge change in tone for the series. Maybe it's really hard keeping up the mystery if much of the ""world"" of Stranger Things already yielded many of its secrets but the overall ""feel"" of the series went into a different direction. Maybe the writers simply ran out of 80' templates to rip off. Season 1 was very much inspired by supernatural horror as in ""Poltergeist"". Season 2 took many cues from ""Creature Features"" like ""Gremlins"" or ""Aliens"". Season 3 now uses elements of 80' zombie flicks and low budget gore horror with a little bit of spy comedy mixed in (and fight scenes which feel straight out of ""Die Hard""). All those genres didn't really mix well in the 80' and this strange cocktail sure doesn't work today. That doesn't mean that Season 3 is bad. It simply relies on characters who were established in previous seasons which used very different 80' story elements and tropes. It's almost like seeing Darth Vader in an Indiana Jones movie. Both work on their own but not together.Basically, Season 3 is an all too transparent attempt to plough a fresh nostalgia field but it doesn't work in the context of previous seasons."

"325","Tweekums"," Nostalgia, horror and sci-fi in one great series","","1 February 2020","This series is set in '80s Hawkins, Indiana. As it opens twelve year old friends Will Byers, Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson and Lucas Sinclair are playing Dungeons and Dragons. Shortly afterwards Will vanishes; he has been taken to 'The Upside Down'; a dark parallel universe. Around the same time a mysterious girl, known as Eleven (shortened to El), turns up. It later becomes apparent that she has telekinetic powers and is being looked for by workers at a secretive facility. As the story progress's Will's friends befriend El and she helps them try to find him. His mother is convinced that he is trying to communicate with her.I've only described the basic plot of season one; the second and third seasons follow on with new, but related stories with most of the same characters and some new ones.I really enjoyed this series from the start of the first season to the end of the third. Perhaps it was because I was in my early teens in the early eighties I really enjoyed the nostalgia factor despite the fact that I was growing up in rural Oxfordshire not small town America... of course I was watching American films like ET and late '50s set 'Stand By Me'. The group of friends in this particularly reminded me of the boys in the latter of those films. The story provides some good scary moments and a great atmosphere with threats that are a combination of fantasy and sci-fi... creatures beautifully mirroring the Dungeon and Dragon monsters in the game the boys play. The characters are great; most obviously the boys, Eleven, Will's mother Joyce and Jim Hopper, the town's sheriff. The cast is really good; the youngsters are really great making their characters believable even during the most fantastical of scenes. Millie Bobby Brown particularly stands out as Eleven; a character that is both vulnerable and at times potentially dangerous. The adult cast is impressive too. The effects, an impressive mix of CGI and physical effects, impressively bring the more supernatural elements of the film to life. Overall I'd certainly recommend this series to fans of the genre... I can't wait for season four."

"327","BrnzReviews"," What A Watch Must See!","","19 July 2022","Stranger Things was an amazing surprise upon watching it I had no idea what kind of adventure was ahead of me. The best way to put this show is a love letter to the '80s classics that captivated a generation. 'Stranger Things' is set in 1983 Indiana, where a young boy vanishes into thin air. As friends, family and local police search for answers, they are drawn into an extraordinary mystery involving top-secret government experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one very strange little girl.I loved everything about this show, the cast were absolutely breathtaking, If I started to note on each one I liked we'd be here all day but some really did stand out to me like Joe Kreery as Steve Harrington, by far my favourite from start to nearly finish as we have one more round to go.I highly recommend watching this, I absolutely loved it! Bring on season to 5!"
"328","chiragrathod19"," One of the best Netflix show.","10/10","23 January 2023","Stranger Things as a whole is one of the best shows I have seen so far. First three seasons have been exciting and stunning but season 4 is extraordinary 👌🏻. The Duffer Brothers knock it out of the park for what I believe that this series is one of the best netflix series so far. There are so many twists and turns and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is one of the most addicting series that I have ever watched. I love the characters so much! The storylines and characters are so fleshed out and watching it gets me emotional and millies acting is superb. Can't wait for season 5.From me 10/10 rating for this masterpiece❤."

"330","SoverniX"," The series is beyond the ideas of the other world!","10/10","5 July 2021","The 8 episodes of the First season flew by unnoticed in the extraordinary film atmosphere. The creators managed to shoot a unique work, in which the motives of famous books and films of previous years are guessed. The sci-fi character sets the main tone for the entire tape, but high-quality directing does not give even a second to get bored. An exciting plot, a cool game of actors, diversity and retrospectives, coupled with fascinating music, immerse the viewer in a world that you do not want to part with. This is a film that is interesting to reflect on, discuss with friends and even draw parallels with your own realities. Each episode is a new batch of intrigues and impressions, secrets and solutions, almost always unpredictable. The ending of the first season leaves a lot of questions...
To the delight of everyone who has managed to fall in love with Stranger Things, the release of season 4 is expected soon, which has been postponed many times due to the pandemic! In the meantime, there is time to reflect on what he saw, and maybe watch the series again in the company of interesting people. I think this film will also appeal to modern teenagers, for whom the entourage of the 80s with its games, customs and traditions will appear in a new light. Everyone in this film will be able to find a favorite hero, according to their ideals and preferences. In particular, I would like to note the highly professional game of Finn Wolfard, who played Michael. His character is an example of a kind, truly bright boy who knows the value of friendship. To be honest, throughout the season I often caught myself thinking an annoying thought - why wasn't I like this as a child? There was also a place for tears, which it was sometimes impossible to restrain (although I am not so sentimental). The film is really addictive, as if you are experiencing events, joy and pain together with the characters. A movie for a wide audience with meaning and a great plot!And who has become your favorite hero for you? And if you haven't watched the first season yet, then don't hesitate and call your friends!"
"331","deloudelouvain"," Back to the eighties!","","4 August 2016","Netflix did it again with Stranger Things. It's a very pleasant and easy to follow series to watch. It's like a time warp back to the eighties. A mixture of The Goonies meets The X-Files meets Close Encounters Of A Third Kind. I watched the whole first season in just a couple days. You immediately get hooked on this show. I don't know if the makers will add another season to it and if they do I'm already very curious what it will be about. Will it be a complete other story or will it just continue where the first season ended? It doesn't matter to me, I just want more seasons like this one. The cast is very good. All the actors fit perfectly well in the story. There is enough suspense to keep you interesting all the time. Watch this one, you won't regret it."
"332","lee_eisenberg"," what we know and don't know can lead to perceptive contrasts","9/10","16 December 2017","Since its debut last year, Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" has become a popular show. I just binge-watched the first season. A couple of things struck me. One is of course the focus on government secrets and how Will's disappearance leads to the realization that this small, idealistic town might not be what it seems. Equally significant is the look at and allusions to 1980s popular culture.* But beyond that, there's the contrast between Will's family and Mike's family. Mike comes from an affluent family in an immaculate house, while Will comes from a working-class family in a house not in the best condition. These set the stage for the eerie events soon to dominate the town.From the first episode, it was clear that this was going to be a good show, and it didn't disappoint. Winona Ryder, as Will's distraught mother, puts on what has to be the best performance of her career. If you only know her from her ""cute"" roles, then you're in for a pleasant surprise. Outstanding series.And remember, the bad men are coming.*I understand that the show's creators tracked down the makers of the era's board games to find out what they got called in foreign languages, so as to be able to properly localize the show in foreign countries."
"333","reddiemurf81"," Season 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","","13 July 2022","I can't believe the first time I tried to watch
the first episode of season 1 I didn't get into. What?!? I must have been having an off day.I thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1-3. The kids are just perfectly cast, and work so well together. The adult cast couldn't be better. I couldn't wait to see what happened after the end of sn 3 (unfortunately,,, lots happened in the world,
and really slowed things down). Then finally,,,Season 4 brought everything to a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEVEL!!! First,, every episode was either a mini movie, or a full blown movie (as far as the run time goes). From the opening of ep 1, everything is different from previous seasons bc our group has become scattered. Joyce, Will, Jonathan, and El are in California now, while everyone else is back in Hawkins. While Jonathan has adapted to life in Cali (he's become a bit of a stoner along with his buddy Argyle, who drives a van to deliver pizza from the SURF PIZZA 🍕 chain), and Joyce has found a thriving new job where she can work from home,, Eleven has had a more difficult time. While still reeling from losing her adoptive Dad, Hopper, along with losing her powers,, she has become the target of ridicule and bullying from a group of California kids at school. At her age, it's tough for any child to adapt to theirs surroundings,, but for El,, the deck is always stacked against her. Will is also having troubles, but for him it's more of the estrangement from everything he's known, along with the realization that he's probably never going to feel normal after what he's been through.In Hawkins, Dustin, Lucas, and Mike have joined a D&D club called Hellfire, by their ""interesting"" leader Eddie Munson (the quintessential metal head of the 80s). However, Lucas has also joined the basketball team in an effort to gain popularity. Max, on the other hand is still reeling from the events that took place at the end of sn 3 (Billy's death, etc). She's even been visiting the school counselor, and although she'd broken up with Lucas at some point, he still tries to reach her to no avail.Nancy is still chasing down stories as a budding journalist while Steve and Robin toil away at the video store (we saw them get hired at in the last ep, sn 3).Overall, life seems to be going okay in Hawkins,, at least on the surface, that is. The upside down is still lurking just on the other side,, and a great evil is making itself known to the teenagers in Hawkins. Especially teens who've gone through certain trauma,,,I don't want to say too much (cause I'll give too much away),, but this season should win all kinds of awards!!! I can only hope that the last season will be as good (don't know how they can top this).So much happening in this season. I really can't emphasize this enough. Your emotions will be drained after watching, but in the best way possible.The big bad guy's name is Vecna, and he is one of THE greatest villains I've ever seen!! So evil, so scary, just incredible.I'm literally on pins and needles wanting to see season 5!! Of course,, we'll probably have to wait til 2024 before they get it on Netflix,,, ugh.P. S. Really!! If you enjoyed sns 1-3,, this season blows them out of the water several times over!!"

"335","pjgs200"," Pretty good but not the masterpiece that so many say it is","","4 September 2016","I'm not gonna write a long review because I don't want to repeat what many others have said. Stranger Things is a good show- it's very well directed and acted, it has a pretty interesting mystery, and some of the first episodes are pretty creepy- but it is nowhere near the level of quality many people say it is. I liked the amount of suspense and horror in the first few episodes, but as the show went on it became more about the uninspired characters and less about the mystery, sci fi and horror, and when we finally saw the Demagorgen it looked really cheap. I've watched all of the episodes, and the only episodes that impressed me were the second one, which had a great first half but dropped the ball a bit in the last 30 minutes, and Holly Jolly. I think (like some people have already said), the super-high rating this show has on IMDb might just be because so many people are nostalgic about the 80's and not because Stranger Things is actually one of the best shows ever. Stranger Things isn't a bad show, but it's nowhere near as good as people say it is."

In my opinion, Brett was totally spot-on for the role.  Never has Holmes in all his complexities been laid before us.  Brett's Holmes is tragic, infuriating, funny, smart, human.  He has his weaknesses to offset his sharp mind and encyclopedic knowledge of low-lifes, drugs, and cigar ash.  Stand-out episodes include The Devil's Foot, The Speckled Band, The Master Blackmailer, The Eligible Batchelor, The Copper Beeches, The Empty House, The Six Napoleons ...  as for the Watsons, David Burke was more amused than amusing, quietly tolerating his friend's unusual personality traits.  Hardwicke was a comedy character, not in the vein of Nigel Bruce in the old movies, but a buffoon with a heart and a mind who could be relied on in a crisis, but often showed his irritation at being woken up in the middle of the night or missing his lunch!  For a whole decade British TV was the better for this long-running series."
"358","vox-sane"," The Best Holmes (and Watson) Ever","10/10","23 September 2003","When I started reading the Holmes canon in grade school, I was struck by the character of Holmes.  He was obnoxious, priggish, intolerant of anyone who was beneath him intellectually (which is almost everyone but Mycroft) and anti-social.  Dr. Watson was a more well-rounded character.  A doctor trained at Edinburgh (which was stringent in Victorian times), a soldier who undoubtedly performed surgery under fire, wounded (twice) and a fine lad with the ladies.  It was clear Holmes needed Watson to operate in society. Without Watson, Holmes would have been a freak.  But in movie versions I caught later (such as the otherwise fine Rathbone/Bruce pairings, and perhaps most egregiously in Bernard Fox's Watson opposite Stewart Granger's Holmes) Holmes appeared to be Watson's keeper;  or, as with Howard Marion-Crawford, Watson was the officious Britisher to a more cosmopolitan Holmes.  Even as late as ""Crucifer of Blood"", Richard Johnson's Watson is something of a dunderhead.  Some of this scurrilous misinterpreting of Watson was chipped away by Colin Blakely in ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"", a misfired comedy;  and some in ""Murder by Decree"" by James Mason's Watson, who, while not as incisive as Christopher Plummer's Holmes, is only dunderheaded on the exterior, and who proves he can take care of himself. But with the advent of the Jeremy Brett ""Sherlock Holmes"", David Burke's Watson, while still not an intellectual rival to Holmes (who is?) is competent, athletic, courageous, and more of a partner to the great detective.  One senses that Holmes needs Watson to operate in society, and Watson needs Holmes as mental stimulation to take him out of his dreary medical practice.""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" is the finest adaptation of the Holmes canon yet.  Taking a few liberties (such as giving Watson some of Holmes' lines or putting Moriarty in ""The Red Headed League"") it nevertheless presents a superb Holmes (Brett) and a Watson who, for the first time, is an invaluable colleague.""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" is a must for any Holmes fan and a great introduction to anyone who doesn't want to read the stories but wants to see a Holmes close to the original as possible.  (Though I was disappointed Burke didn't return in the ""Return of Sherlock Holmes"" series, Edward Hardwicke continued the tradition of an accomplished Watson, but also giving him a mellowed flavor like fine old vintage wine)."
"359","alfa-16"," Definitive in all respects","","3 June 2004","If you are going to buy one Conan Doyle DVD let this be it. If you're going to watch a single episode, let it be The Crooked Man.For this is as good as it gets. We have a glorious incarnation of Holmes and Watson here. Brett's Holmes - cantankerous, affected, whimsical, rude, arrogant, precipitous, charming - can only have been drawn from the deepest possible understanding of the text. There have been similar efforts along the same lines, though none so successful. No other Holmes has come close to Brett's portrayal of the brilliant but obsessed mind, teetering on the knife edge dividing madness and genius.Brett's portrayal of Holmes is enough to lift this series above any other. But Granada (who are damn good at this sort of thing when they try) have nailed the two other vital essences of the stories and this makes their achievement unique. Firstly we have a totally new take on Watson, a brisk, wonderfully intelligent man of action, a fearless fellow crime fighter and stalwart support. As David Burke leads Holmes round the Aldershot camp in The Crooked Man, you understand exactly what Holmes found appealing in the bluff ex-soldier, who chronicles his victories, appreciates and learns his methods and soothes his clients when Holme's interrogation causes offence. This is new and unsurpassed. I prefer Burke's to Hardwicke's more thoughtful Watson. Both are top drawer character actors with fantastic credits, but for me, Burke has an impulsiveness and breezy candour that gives his Watson extra light and colour. Hardwicke, in the later series, does a lot more to suggest the difficulty of living with a man like Holmes.An even more significant achievement is the recreation of the deft energy, economy and speed with which Conan Doyle transports his audiences into the heart of Victorian London. Only Dickens did it with anything like the same authority and style. Lovers of the fantastic Sydney Paget illustrations will recognise his work everywhere in the props and scenery. Many of the more famous illustrations are lovingly recreated, but this is really about the chemistry of detail and pace. Granada have the formula just right. So perfect in fact, that when they try to extend it to feature length, it fails, just as Conan Doyle failed in his own attempts to extend the format to novel-length stories. The longer pieces are again, the weakest of the set.If this disk doesn't fill you with delight, go back to the text, read again and look again, or you risk undervaluing one of the greatest achievements of TV drama.Sir Arthur, I'm sure, would have been both delighted and impressed."
"360","Coxer99"," The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes","10/10","9 June 1999","Splendid television series about Arthur Conan Doyle's master detective. The series was catapulted by an intense performance by Jeremy Brett, who was a true vision and David Burke as the first Dr. John Watson. The role would later go to Edward Hardwicke, the son of actor Sir Cedric Hardwicke. The series was quite popular in the states as well as in England. Each episode was well paced and about 90 percent of the time faithful to Conan Doyle's literary works. It took chances. It took risks and it was successful. For Brett, it was the character he would be remembered for. Thank God for him...he played the part masterfully."
"361","Tinlizzy"," One of the very best television series ever made.","","31 October 1999","This superb series is not only the best adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes stories that I have ever seen (and I have seen a few), it is one of the best television series ever made, period. Some episodes are better cinema than many feature films made at the same time. It is amazing to see the way Granada and the cast and crew kept the quality consistently high in every episode of this series, as well as the second series of the ADVENTURES, the RETURN, and the adaptation of THE SIGN OF FOUR. Later shows showed some decline in the quality of the writing and direction, and the illness of star Jeremy Brett also had a deletrious effect. But there is no negating what went before. Jeremy Brett leaves all the other actors I've seen play Holmes in the shade, and both David Burke and Edward Hardwicke are marvellous as Dr. Watson. For the first time, I believed that these men were good friends. Why has it taken over a century for someone to play them in this fashion? The credit goes to the people involved in this landmark production. The biggest crime in the series: why no professional awards or nominations for such marvellous work? There is no excuse for this. Watch the shows on video, recent broadcasts butcher the life out of these wonderful treasures."
"362","planktonrules"," You simply cannot make these shows any better","9/10","30 March 2008","I have reviewed a ton of Sherlock Holmes films over the years since I am a huge fan of the original Conan Doyle stories. However, despite enjoying these films, I must admit that the many movies up until ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" have really done a disservice to the stories. Part of this is because they so often strayed from the original stories (which were gems) and partly because they portrayed Holmes in ways that were totally different from the stories.The Sherlock Holmes the public assumes is from the Conan Doyle stories is actually mostly the product of the actor William Gillette. On stage and in silent films, he popularized the image of the deerstalker cap (which Holmes only really wore when traveling in the country--if even then), the curved pipe and the phrase ""elementary, my dear Watson"". Instead, in the books the Conan Doyle character would have dressed and acted exactly the way Jeremy Brett did in these TV mini-movies.It's obvious that the makers of these films really cared. Holmes was like Holmes and the plots were almost always exactly like the stories with only the smallest of changes to fit the time frame and tell a cohesive story.See these films. They are literate, intelligent and trust the original source material. I congratulate all those involved in these beautiful shows. Unfortunately, however, Jeremy Brett passed away a few years back and we won't see any more of these Holmes shows, though it is fortunate that before his death they brought so many of them to the screen. Too bad one of my favorites (""The Four Orange Pips"") wasn't one of them. However, my very favorite (""A Scandal in Bohemia"") was!"
"363","TheLittleSongbird"," No doubt about it- Masterpiece!!!","","21 October 2009","I cannot praise this masterpiece of a series enough. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it whatsoever. In fact every one of the Sherlock Holmes are superb, but this is the definitive one.The plots are in general true to the books, which are just as excellent, save a couple of wholly forgivable liberties. The scripts are sharp, classy and sophisticated, and all the adaptations have a certain atmosphere to them, and that is exactly what I want. The music is just outstanding, not only beautiful but very haunting, and the background music is rich and just adds to the atmosphere of the series. And the scenery, camera work and costumes are flawless.As for the acting, one word, superlative. Jeremy Brett is without doubt the best Sherlock Holmes ever, he is just perfect as the character. He is true to the character of the books, while making some subtle differences along the way. This is all to do with interpretation, and where I am concerned, this is one masterful interpretation of a truly complex character. David Burke is suitably intelligent as Watson; while I am more familiar with Edward Hardwicke, Burke is just as good. Many great actors and actresses have come and given memorable appearances, and I cannot decide who impressed me most, because they were all great.All in all, an absolute must-see. It is a television masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"364","BeckyKmovieluver"," BRILLIANT!!!!!","10/10","12 September 2004","I have only seen a few episiodes of the Jeremy Brett version of 'Sherlock Holmes' but already (to me) Jeremy Brett is THE 'Sherlock Holmes'. He gives the character a real personality and not only plays the character but BECOMES the character. I know that Jeremy Brett was not always comfortable with the character and lacked confidence in his portrayal of 'Sherlock Holmes' but to me he is the ULTIMATE Sherlock!!!! It's so unfourtunate that a character who ultimately brought such pleasure to so many people brought the actor such a mix of joy and misery!!!! Jeremy Brett was a great actor and a great man and thats why he is one of my all time favourite actors!!!!!"
"365","propsguy"," simply the best","","16 October 1999","Jeremy Brett is by far the best Holmes to date and his passing is truly a great shame. All of his representations of Holmes should not be missed. The rest of the cast are excellent. The sets and costumes are supurb as well."
"366","javvie"," A masterpiece of television!","10/10","28 February 2004","This is a Sherlock Holmes series that is absolutely faithful to the original stories. The excellent cast with Jeremy Brett in the lead leaves no wishes open. Many roles were given to icons of British drama and cinema, such as Charles Gray, Eric Porter, John Castle, Joss Ackland and Eric Sykes. Others went to upcoming stars of the late 80s such as Marina Sirtis and Natasha Richardson. The mise-en-scene was certainly not only developed true to the books, but it was also inspired by Sidney Paget's drawings, which were published together with the early stories in the ""Strand Magazine"" from the beginning of the 1890s onwards. Compare, for example, the King of Bohemia, who faces Holmes as a masked stranger, or the struggle of Holmes and Moriarty at the Reichenbach falls in Switzerland.This series is a true masterpiece of television."
"367","Sleepin_Dragon"," Phenomenal.","","7 January 2020","I wonder when they had completed the first series, if they wondered just what they had made, a series loved by many years later, and the creation of Brett's Sherlock Holmes, for many, myself included, the ultimate Sherlock Holmes.This first batch of mysteries is incredible, it's a wonderful series of faithful adaptations. They are exquisitely made, with great direction, flawless detail, with sets and costumes that to this day look fantastic.Jeremy Brett is fabulous in the role, he's sincere, charismatic, energetic and still the best to play the part. David Burke is also wonderful here, he's charming and handsome, whilst I always saw Hardwicke as being the closer to the character in the book, Burke was wonderful, and the pair had great chemistry.So many wonderful episodes, it's hard to pick out a favourite, however my personal trio of choice, The Copper Beeches, Speckled Band and The Final Problem. There is no weak link in this series.Excellent guest performances, watch out for Joss Ackland, Jeremy Kemp and Eric Porter.TV doesn't get much better than this. 10/10"
"368","AaronCapenBanner"," Jeremy Brett Became Sherlock Holmes!","10/10","19 August 2013","Outstanding adaptations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's celebrated stories is exemplary; Jeremy Brett was an inspiration in the role, capturing the eccentricity, curiosity, impatience, yet strong moral convictions of the famous detective. He was supported in this first series superbly by David Burke, who does not play it like a lovable bumbler, but an honorable and loyal friend who simply has his hands full keeping up with the genius that is Holmes.Handsome and authentic productions enhance the atmosphere in these intelligent stories; all are first-rate, and deserve multiple viewings to appreciate how much skill went into this.A masterpiece!"
"369","Deusvolt"," Granada Studios and Jeremy Brett set the palladium standard for all portrayals of the eccentric Victorian detective.","","6 July 2005","These comments apply to all the Sherlock Holmes series and episodes produced by Granada and starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and either Burke or Hardwicke as Watson.Brett certainly gave the most definitive portrayal of Holmes. One must remember that Holmes, although a decent and upright gentleman had his dark side -- his conceit, impatience with people of lesser intelligence and, as a product of imperial Victorian England, he displayed traces of jingoism, racism, sexism and hypocrisy. Note that episode where he remarks on the French surname of a suspect or in the cavalier manner he uses pejoratives to refer to peoples of Asiatic origin. In another episode he tells Watson that his nemesis is ""but a woman."" Expecting high moral standards of others, he was nevertheless a drug addict (cocaine in the original stories by Doyle and also absinthe in the Granada series). He also used smoked opium occasionally when in disguise to track down suspects or missing persons. In one episode he was caught red-handed by Watson (the one portrayed by Hardwicke) with a syringe although it is not certain what drug it was supposed to contain, probably morphine as I doubt if heroin had already been extracted from opium at that time. These flaws viewed in the context of the era and of the peculiar circumstances of Holmes, instead of making him out as an ogre, make him all the more human and believable. On the whole, however, Brett's Holmes is exceedingly kind, self sacrificing and high minded. He could also be quite droll and able to take jokes at his expense as when a phrenologist remarked that he would very much like to take a cast of the cranium of the very intelligent Holmes ""until the original should become available."" Note that he rarely collects fees and places life and limb on the line for his clients. No wonder the sophisticatedly discerning French have a Jeremy Brett society. Between Burke and Hardwicke as Watson, one is likely to vote for Burke as he is funnier, younger and better looking. But Hardwicke better displays the character of a retired officer of the Indian (Imperial British) Army by his physical courage and readiness to use his firearm. His portrayal also brings out the difficult side of Holmes. It was to Hardwicke's Watson that Holmes unusually expresses (in a letter in Hound of the Baskervilles) deep concern and affection with such words as ""there is nothing that I desire more than to have you safely back in our Baker st. lodgings.""Finally, if you have seen all the episodes, watch them again and keep your eyes peeled for those delicious antiques -- porcelain washbowls, iron stoves, 19th century lamps, brass door knockers, handsome hansoms and carriages, even a pristine horse drawn red and brass fire engine with immaculate white hoses. And were those mansions, manor houses and country cottages merely sets or genuine locations? I suspect the latter. I would suggest to the English that they revise their Sherlock Holmes tours to include visits to places where Granada shot the series."
"370","grdnbryc"," I'm a total convert","8/10","12 August 2004","I must confess that until a few years ago I fully believed in the deer-stalker wearing, beak-nosed incarnation of Sherlock Holmes as seen on bill-boards and children's cartoons. Then one night my father persuaded me to watch this series on TV and after that I just had to read the stories to find out what had happened.Ever since then I have watched every Sherlock Holmes movie that ever came on TV just so I could shout abuse at it, all except this series. Of course it has its faults as does every good thing but there can be little denying that when it came to the casting of the lead it could have not been more perfect.Brett brings such an energy to the part that is sorely missing in other adaptations. Few other Holmes's have thrown themselves onto dusty floorboards with such gusto or made the veins stand out on their brows in anger. He is deceptively charming and at the same time faintly unsettling, not to mention immensely funny at the correct moment. With him we get a Holmes who, it can be said, is a full human being, flawed but only in the way that a diamond may be flawed, that does not mean it is not still a diamond.The supporting cast is also excellent with David Burke and Edward Hardewick providing slightly different but equally good Watson's.Anyone who claims to be a great fan of the stories but does not like this adaptation should look again at the narratives and hang their heads in shame."
"371","suicidea"," Pretty much everything has been said, but...","","11 October 2020","Pretty much everything has been said about this magnificent work, but seeing as there are only 55 reviews so far (while comic book adaptations typically get 5500 reviews) I felt I owed it to the people involved to say something.I won't go into how Jeremy Brett is the definitive Holmes etc, that's already mentioned abundantly. What I have to say, first of all, is how much a work of love this adaptation is, and it reflects upon the viewing experience. You can feel it in every frame, every bit of dialogue, every camera movement. From the producer to the actors to the set workers, these people obviously enjoyed what they were making, and I don't know if they had any idea how it would be treasured for decades to come, but I have a feeling that they did guess so.So much has transferred from the pages to the screen that it leaves you in awe. Many bits of dialogue exactly as they were written, mannerisms, sets and costumes... In one particular episode (The Red-Headed League) there's a short scene where Holmes and Watson are at a violin performance. The musician's role was very brief and had no dialogue, but his appearance was so unique that I wondered if it was on purpose, and had a meaning. After watching the episode, I checked online and found out that I was correct: the actor was deliberately made to look like the real musician he was portraying. This is the definition of a work of love: The story would be just as entertaining and complete even without that detail, but they actually made an effort to make even that minor scene as authentic as possible.In another episode (The Resident Patient) the doctor is taking notes about his patient, and asks him if he drinks alcohol. He replies ""Vodka,"" and you can see from the doctor's hand movements that he's actually writing the word ""vodka"" among his notes, although the camera doesn't see his writing. He doesn't simply pretend to scribble, he's actually taking real notes.The attention to detail doesn't end there, of course. In a series where every interior, every house, room, police station etc. is filled with glass cabinets, shiny objects and silverware, you'll be hard pressed to catch the reflection of a crew worker or a cameraman (although you can catch dozens of them in 100-million dollar productions).The best thing about the whole canon, of course, is the production's respect to the intelligence of the audience. Unlike the dozens of previous Holmes productions, this one doesn't present Dr. Watson as a near-imbecile whose only purpose is to be awed at every conclusion Sherlock arrives at. Here he's a valuable companion. And Sherlock himself isn't a perfect man, either: He has his faults, as well as quirks, all lovingly portrayed by Jeremy Brett.Although the later episodes of the whole Brett canon lose their momentum somewhat, each one still has something to offer: some dialogue, some acting, something that will stick in your memory.It's more than a little curious as to why these wonderful stories had never been filmed as they were written until then, although they had been adapted numerous times. Even more have been made since this one, and still others will be made. But in many people's minds, Mr. Brett's face will be the first image to appear upon the mention of the name of Holmes."
"372","waasmusic"," The best adaptation of Holmes","9/10","10 January 2004","This 40 minute gem is currently being rerun on a Saturday afternoon on BB2 in England. Jeremy Brett makes a fantastic Holmes. Always slightly on edge with the right accent & demeanour, he really makes this programme the perfect example to how Holmes should be played. David Burke also plays a perfect Watson without appearing the slightest bit ""bumbly"" like in the rest of the adaptations. A definate 10/10"
"373","rmax304823"," As Good As It's Likely to Get.","","22 March 2010","Jeremy Brett is Holmes all the way through the series and he probably animates Conan-Doyle's detective better than any of the others who have played him on the screen. He doesn't LOOK that much like the Sidney Paget illustrations. He's a little short, but that's about the only problem. His face and figure are lean and his movements are suitably quick or languid, depending on whether he has a case or not.Basil Rathbone had the advantage of height and of resembling the illustrations more closely, but Rathbone lacked the tic-y quality and the frigid aloofness that characterized Holmes. Brett is an arrogant and superior thinking machine. Rathbone was a detective of intensity. And, really, only once did Rathbone's Holmes refer to the use of an illicit drug. At the end of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles,"" Rathbone snaps out -- ""Oh, Watson -- the needle."" The TV series went through two Watsons, equally good, and close to Conan-Doyle's original, rather than the well-intentioned buffoon of Rathbone's Watson.Like many of the English mystery series, occasional well-known movie figures would show up to take roles -- Natasha Richardson here, Jeremy Kemp there. Even Harry Andrews. Their presence added variety to the series.""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" was the first set of episodes in the series. As the years went on, the adapters were forced to draw on some of the lesser tales. ""The Creeping Man"" still makes me wince -- in print or on film. And the cast was hobbled by a personal crisis in Jeremy Brett's life, and by his continuing struggle with heart failure. His lost his ascetic look and became plumper and older. Finally, the writers seemed to become desperate, making up pastiches and having Holmes practically fall in love while in disguise.But it's impossible to criticize the presentation of the first couple of years. The period detail and photography are magnificent, and Brett gives Holmes all the quirks and aversions that made him compassionate without ever allowing him to be warm."
"374","ericksonsam60"," Sherlock Holmes Doesn't Get Any Better Than This","10/10","17 August 2011","Whether you grew up reading Arthur Conan Doyle's stories of Sherlock Holmes or not (I didn't), this superbly crafted, lavishly produced series from Granada Television is arguably by far the best filmed version of Sherlock Holmes. With faithful translations that are artfully done, historical accurate, and acted to perfection. It aired on ITV in England and in America aired on PBS's Anthology series Mystery!. It became a popular series running from 1984 to 1994 in four volumes along with five feature length films.However, the main attraction is Jeremy Brett, by far the definitive Sherlock Holmes to me. No actor previously has played him more masterfully and memorably than him and will remain an incredibly difficult act to follow for who decide to play Holmes in the future. His performance makes Holmes into a complex character. His Holmes is conceited, melancholy, eccentric, and often very aloof, being a brilliant but very human detective. Brett truly captured a man whose mind is always at work. He truly embodies the role showing nothing but prowess in each and every performance. Whenever, I think of Sherlock Holmes it will always be his Sherlock Holmes.In ""Adventures"", David Burke makes a wonderful Dr. Watson bringing a certain exuberance to the role. His Watson is not the annoying buffoon that Nigel Bruce was but an intelligent person that can hold his own and plays off very well with Holmes. I just love the banter they have. Burke's Watson is also impulsive and always makes room for humor. He would be replaced afterward in later volumes by Edward Hardwicke whose take is different but equally excellent.The series also had fine supporting casts which included Rosalie Williams as Holmes's motherly housekeeper Mrs. Hudson, Charles Gray as Holmes's brother Mycroft, who is as brilliant if not more so than Holmes himself, and Colin Jeavons as the inept Inspector Lestrade, who thinks he can outdo Holmes in solving cases but always ends up being proved wrong. Also, Eric Porter made a very menacing Professor Moriarty.Another thing that stands out in the Granada series is the vivid period flavor. It makes you feel like your there in Victorian Era England with the mansions, countrysides, trains, and horse drawn carriages. The interiors of houses look like they would during this period, especially with the look of Holmes flat on 221 B Baker Street. You can tell that the makers of the series went to incredible lengths to make every detail accurate to the era and in the text. This series has the finest locations, costumes, props, and sets that I've ever seen.""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" is the first and best volume in the series. It has several of the finest adaptations that Granada has to offer. Episodes such as ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", ""The Greek Interpreter"", and ""The Final Problem"" are sensational. Although, my personal favorites are ""The Crooked Man,"" ""The Copper Beeches,"" and ""The Blue Carbuncle"". The tales in this volume are the most playful and just like the title, they are adventurous. The photography and directing in these is magnificent giving the stories great visual flavor. These are classy adaptations of classic stories.This series is a must watch for Holmes fans, mystery lovers, and anyone who craves high quality television."
"375","Rueiro"," Nicely crafted with the usual British flair for period dramas","","3 June 2012","I read my first Sherlock Holmes stories when I was a little boy, I saw the great Peter Cushing in ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" when I was a teenager, and then Basil Rathbone, Robert Stephens and Christopher Plummer, all which were very good in different degrees. But it was the late Jeremy Brett (the posh Freddy Eynsford-Hill in ""My Fair Lady"", can you believe it?!- who, to this day and in my most sincere opinion, has played the best Sherlock Holmes ever. Now every time I re-read Doyle's stories, I can not picture anyone else in my mind but Brett as the great detective. I can hear his voice and see his gestures, and with all my respects to all the others who preceded him, Mr Brett shall remain my favourite Holmes ever, with his outbursts of temper, his sudden enthusiasm at the challenge of a new case, his cynicism, his drug-addition and his vanity, but also his sense of human justice that sometimes stand above the law. He shows Holmes' virtues and faults as a human being, and can be as admirable as pompous and even irritating at times, like any human being can be. In my opinion, he perfectly captures Holmes' psychology. Not long ago I acquired the DVD set of the excellent TV series made by Granada between 1984 and 1995. In the first season, David Burke makes a clumsy, bit foolish and humorous Dr. Watson. Then he was replaced by Edward Hardwicke, who brought a more gentler side to the character, a bit more self-composed and equally lovable. And Colin Jeavons as foolish Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, a pompous inept ass who is always fun and one of my favourite characters in the series. It is a real pity that the death of Jeremy Brett in 1995 brought an end to this magnificent series. And then a few months ago, I learnt with sadness that Edward Harwicke had just also passed away. I would like this review to be a little tribute to the two of them, for all the cosy entertaining evenings they have given me. Thank you."

I even dare say, forget about the plot, forget about the movie itself, and just watch Brett and enjoy. This, of course, must not make us forget the excellent adaptation of each story, too faithful sometimes."

"378","tinytots2"," A nigh impeccable adaptation","7/10","29 December 2021","As adaptations go, this is as close to perfect as they come. Arthur Conan Doyle's famous stories are realized faithfully and brilliantly with scarce a single blemish. The urban city Victorian era feel is brought out beautifully in the sets, the dialogue and scene design are taken directly from the source text, the acting is magnificent all round with especial praise due to the on-point portrayal of Holmes and Watson, and the episodic plots are paced well to make for a gripping watch. Music is used aptly to build tension or elevate emotion and the direction and cinematography are also excellent.My one criticism is that some of the stories selected make for rather forgettable television mysteries. This can be because the source material may itself be less compelling; even if judging a work's quality is subjective, some of the short stories are definitely regarded as better than others. It could also be an effect of the translation to the television screen as a significant part of the episode's runtime gets spent describing the facts and particulars of the case. This is less apparent when reading the books since the descriptive passages therein feature more in the staging, props, costuming and enacting of the show instead of being incorporated in the script.Nonetheless, for lovers of the famed consulting detective, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a very rewarding and entertaining watch. It has aged gracefully and should also be enjoyed by aficionados of episodic whodunits."

Most other versions either add or subtract for cinematic effect and hereby ruin the purity of the work. For example, most other versions go on the stage stereo type of Holmes in a deer stalker cap and always smoking a pipe at a crime-scene and saying ""elementary my dear Watson"".....which he never does in any of the books!!! It is in short, a very honourable tribute to that great detective."

Why? Because of the sheer attention to detail. Aside from the fully historically accurate costumes and locations, the show is just gorgeous to look at. The lighting, the cinematography, and everything else visual about it is on point. It's quite apparent none of that money went to waste.The show doesn't just look gorgeous, though. It is also compelling, well written, and well performed. In fact, almost every element is perfectly executed, which means that no single one stands out above the rest, but rather they work in harmony. And that is the show's greatest success; the fact that it all comes together smoothly into a neat, binge-able, high quality package.Mind you, the reason I enjoy the Crown so much is that I knew what to expect when I went into it. This is NOT a fast-paced, action-packed, edge-of-your-seat experience. It is a character drama about the royal family. It runs at a slow pace. Yet it is gripping all the same. That's why it is so good to know that Netflix made such a large investment in this series; they're taking chances and funding original and unusual things in an era when Hollywood is afraid to do anything that isn't already an existing intellectual property. I hope that the Crown blows up like Stranger Things. I hope it gets all the attention it deserves."

It chronicles the life of Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family from the 1940's to modern times.

Actress Claire Foy is beautifully riveting in the role of Elizabeth; someone who wants to have a normal life and yet is made to feel her duty as Queen should be the highest priority. It has been suggested the Queen is warm, has a sense of humor, is compassionate and this portrayal conveys it. She is wise enough to realize she's going to have to forge her own way as those around her are stymied in their own limitations or ignorance. John Lithgow transforms into Winston Churchill and is equally stellar. Their scenes together are superb. If Peter Morgan's research is accurate I can fully appreciate how Princess Diana must have felt. The show is rounded out by a wonderful supporting cast. This show is my favorite Netflix production so far."
"388","linnet100"," This is simply Outstanding","9/10","16 November 2016","Every so often a drama comes along that takes away your breath. Sometimes that's subjective, other times objective. Dramas such as The Jewel in the Crown, The West Wing, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Downton Abbey, House M.D. have all stood at the pinnacle of television drama.The Crown is right up there at the very top. It is outstanding in every way: faultless. From brilliant dramatisation to acting to score to cinematography: everywhere you look it commands.Watch it. You won't regret it. You will remember one of those television 'moments' that come along all too rarely."
"389","shoppsi"," Binge Watching after the Death of Queen Elizabeth 2","","11 September 2022","Queen Elizabeth 2 just passed away and I have been binge watching almost all of Season one in the past 2 days since she died, may she rest in peace.This is so good. I don't know how I missed it when it came out back in 2016, but I'm so happy to get to watch it on Netflix now.It is riveting, beautiful, and moving, and I'm so looking forward to watching the rest.It was moving, watching the king die on the show and seeing young Queen Elizabeth first starting out, when now in real life she has passed and her son Charles is now King and taking over. Gives a real sense of time moving on and stopping for no one."
"390","Britinmiami"," Brilliant TV","9/10","20 November 2019","This is a great series, and for older Brits (Baby boomers), the historical significance is stunning. The first series of actors did an excellent job, and now we are into the second series, and the acting just got better and better!Olivia Coleman is brilliant, as usual. The episode on the Welsh disaster in Aberfan was so well done and very sad. I intend to watch this many times as it is of high quality. I wish all TV were this good and such a high standard.Binge it!"
"391","qais_kawar"," A Majestic series","","20 November 2019","By season 3, the series has kept a high level of professionalism, acting, and story even when they changed every single actor !! Such an extraordinary series !!"
"392","moviemom23"," Season 3 Ep. 6 still not used to Colman","10/10","18 November 2019","I almost didn't watch S. 3 at all when I heard Foy was out and Colman was in. Frankly, it's a different show. Colman is completely miscast. In a major way, it's her appearance but it's also her acting. You get the feeling there's a soulfulness she's fighting down deep, but with Foy you didn't have that and it was just more Right for a queen. I can't explain it she's just not good in this role. Foy had that royal stoicness was about her, Colman is too clunky. The overwrought Ep. 3, which could have been so powerful if not for Colman's performance. The beginning was excellent then the Queen appears and it's ruined. The ending of that episode was just plain bad- predictable and fake.The writing seems to have suffered some too.I adore Helena Bonham Carter but again her appearance also is so distracting. She's a completely different character. The previous Margaret was So Much Better and I keep comparing her to the old one as I watch. It honestly makes it difficult to concentrate on what's going on!All I can say is, yes, I'll see it to the end despite my extreme disappointment with the change of actresses.It's not as noticeable with Prince Phillip, but agewise all 3 previous actors could have been made up to age. It's 15 years later but this Queen and Margaret look 30+ years older! Colman looks nothing like Queen E 2 and in addition both Bonham Carter and Colman have deep-set dark brown eyes it's just not surmountable even if the acting was 1000 percent and it's just not.
Just so terribly miscast. A shame.
Every episode I watch I'm thinking: if only...."
"393","mhtannous"," Huge fan, but season 5?","","9 November 2022","What happened in season five?I'm 5 episodes in and they seem to have abandoned their format.Before it was real life historical events in Britain jusxtosposed against how the royal family was effected or involved.This tension created the drama.Without the historical Britain piece I am just watching boring, spoiled characters.The show really suffered this season.I was so excited for it. And it's just not the same show this season.Characters are ""all right"". But their plots droll on.There isn't enough to fill ten episodes.I'm not British, but it does sort of feel like an agenda.Or they over edited it after the Queens death so as not to ""affect her legacy."
"394","mccann3010"," Wow! Tremendous series and the period details are painstaking and luscious","10/10","20 November 2019","I watched with bated breath as Olivia Coleman took over from Claire Foy. Coleman embodies a mature Elizabeth, one who is calcified into a Royal with a stoic countenance, dowdy wardrobe, and a hint of what the crown has given and cost her.What really blew me away was the lavish attention to detail and period. The public and private spaces are painted in luscious colors, the furniture upholstered with richly hued brocade (so are the women come to think of it). The salons and libraries decorated with massive wood furniture. It's not comfortable - you can almost feel the drafty cold circulating throughout the palace, but it is a showstopper. No wonder they wore wool sweaters and tartan wool suits while lounging about."
"395","hyacintoblack"," S3. Good but... what were they thinking","","23 November 2019","Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth, Helena Bonham Carter as Margaret? Such bad casting. Olivia has a rough face and looks angry most of the time throughout the episodes. Helena Bonham Carter, although a great actress, doesn't do Margaret any justice at all (she doesn't look anything like Margaret)
The first two series were much better because of the actors. Series 3 has great topics but the actors were cast wrongly except the nun princess Alice and prince Charles. They were excellent."

"397","koofasa"," Like every other decent show...","","15 November 2020","This show was highjacked by that group of Hollywood ideologues that insists on rewriting history. Queen Elizabeth was never an activist and I don't think she hated Margaret Thatcher the way the show portrays in season 4. I really enjoyed the first 3 seasons of the show because it was so well presented in a more-or-less honest way. Delicate issues were handled carefully and much was left to our imagination. Not so in Season 4. Here QEII is a full on leftist activist. It is uncomfortable because it is so false. If the producers had to show us their contempt for Thatcher, there were so many honest ways to do that. Thrusting this belief system on the queen with no proof is like the fake news we see on BBC. So sad but definitely predictable. In the late 1970's the world was in a deep recession with inflation. We called it stagflation. Interest rates and unemployment were very high. There were long lines for gas in the US. That's when the world turned right and elected Reagan and Thatcher who pulled the western world out of the economic doldrums. The Crown is rewriting history for 2020 political purposes. I was there and this show is misrepresenting history."
"398","info-19036-16123"," wake me up when it's done","10/10","10 November 2022","The royal family can rest easy. All the worries about a delicate fifth season were completely unfounded as viewers fall asleep after the second episode and stop after the fourth episode and watch something else. I was so looking forward to the new season, like so many others. But it's unbearably slow, boring, uninteresting, and unimportant. Big disappointment. Lady diana and prince charles are played very well. That has to be said. The similarity of facial expressions and gestures is spot on. It's just a shame that you're following other characters all the time that you don't know and aren't interested in."
"399","dsmithchesterfield"," Acting at its finest","","4 November 2016","Where to start is very difficult when it comes to what I can only describe as an amazing feat of production and acting. The cast are absolutely outstanding and are nothing but professional.You can tell a lot of effort has been put into the research and accuracy of the story line. The attention to detail also has to be credited.I can't find a fault and believe me I've tried. Having watched previous biopics/Dramas regarding royalty I will have to put this at the Top and that is including The Queen which again I would rate at 10/10.In summery a must watch if you are looking for a great piece of production and a stimulating story line. I would recommend this to anyone."
"400","michelle_kummer"," Season 5 disappoints","10/10","11 November 2022","I had been looking so forward to season 5 only to be disappointed.It was so boring compared to the previous seasons, Claire Foy played the best queen and did the middle aged queen.Unfortunately season 5 the cast all but Diana don't look like the real life royals. Charles was miscast the actor is good, however they could have used some prosthetics for the big ears and nose. He was far too handsome compared to the real Charles, Camilla looks like Camilla, Philip doesn't resemble the real one either.The actress that plays Diana tries a little too hard always with those doe eyes Diana was charming, sweet and charismatic.It was interesting about the Tzars and seeing Diana visiting her brother and the breaks failing, knowing her phone was hacked.. they tackled some of the taboo subjects including Philips affair. I didn't know he called the Queen Cabbage she always did look so old even when young.Hopefully season 6 is better as this was way too boring I lost interest in every episode."
"401","magnoliacream"," Engrossing highlights of Queen Elizabeth II's reign","","15 September 2022","The crown depicts the highlights of Elizabeth II's life from just before she became queen through the vicissitudes of being the symbolic head of one of the world's most powerful nations. Just a young married mother when she ascended the throne at age 25 in 1952, she survived one prime minister after another, family scandals that rocked the world and tragedies both national and personal. Her marriage with Phillip of Mountbatten, while rocky at first, became one of the pillars of strength which she leaned on.Through it all, Elizabeth remained ever aware of her divinely-anointed responsibility to put the well-being of the crown above everything on earth, even above her family and herself. And this is one aspect of the British monarchy that I find most admirable, even relevant - how monarchs like Victoria, Elizabeth I and Elizabeth II take their duty to the crown utterly seriously. One of the coronation rites mentioned in the drama was the anointing of Elizabeth as queen. This part of the ceremony is not shown to the public and was not shown onscreen. But it greatly intrigued me because of how powerfully it seemed to have affected the monarchs, making them faithful and dedicated to the crown. If only all heads of states around the world are as serious and dedicated to their duties!The drama is well directed and acted. It is reported to be among the most expensive TV series and it shows. The quality of production is top-notch."
"402","auuwws"," The crown","7/10","7 December 2020","The series was a great acting performance in the series, especially from Claire Foy, and she deserved the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her embodiment of the life of the Queen when she was young, and Olivia Coleman for embodying the life of the Queen. While she was middle aged, Matt Smith for his portrayal of Prince Philip If Gillian Anderson doesn't win a Golden Globe for Best Actress, the award is unfair. The biggest negative about the series is its slowness and some characters like Princess Margaret. Although there is some distortion in history that did not spoil the series, I am very excited about the fifth season of The Crown"
"403","cala3"," Season 3 is a huge disappointment","","2 December 2019","Claire Foy was absolutely on point as the Queen in Season 1 and 2. Why mess with that? They totally could have altered her appearance to age her. I love HBC but I don't see her as Princess Margaret.... This season is so dreadfully slow and lacking in any momentum.What a disappointment"
"404","sarah_sle"," Would have been a 10","8/10","19 January 2020","Why, why, why did they think they needed to change the whole staff?! I was very invested in the actors from 1&2 and then everyone is gone! And these new ones don't even resemble the others at all!! Whoever thought this was a good idea is crazy! Lost another viewer!"
"405","kayabay"," A Truly Masterpiece! Royal as it must be!","","15 November 2016","The Crown is almost one of the best period movies ( or better say, series of movies ) ever made. It defines the quality of historic period film making with every aspect. The casting is superior, the cinematography is outstanding, the thoughtfully written script just fixes you to the chair and you cannot stop yourself for several hours to watch it through. I personally watched it all twice to digest all the details prepared for the audience. I must admit The Crown easily made me a Netflix fan & a paid member after a quick glimpse at the trailer. A fortune is spent but worth every penny. Thanks to the producers, the amazing directors and the wonderful cast."
"406","lucasbuenofm"," Elegant, extraordinarily written and acted","10/10","20 November 2019","Probably one of the finest series currently streaming, with breathtaking cinematography, well developed stories and character arcs, with an astonishing cast. Olivia Colman replaced the great Claire Foy with brilliance, and the whole cast does an excellent job at portraying the characters, both in seasons 1/2 and the newly cast season 3. The amazing thing about the show is that, at the same time, the stories and people are portrayed as epic and down to earth. Nuanced and extravagant. I loved every single minute of it and I hope it continues for a very long time."
"407","TheLittleSongbird"," A crowning achievement","","16 April 2018","Love historical dramas, and it fascinated me just as much to see one centred around (as of now) our longest reigning monarch, a title that for a long time was given to Queen Victoria. There was so much talent involved that my interest was sparked further, despite admittedly not being the biggest fan of Netflix. 'The Crown' turned out to be a wonderful series, at its very best some of the best television seen in a while and in a completely different league to much of anything else Netflix has done (so much so that it had to be a check to see that it definitely came from Netflix). Season 1 was so well executed in every regard, while Season 2 boasted even richer material. Totally get the adoration, while sharing some viewers' misgivings about the inaccuracies and some biased and distorted characterisations (the Duke and Duchess of Windsor coming off worst). Vanessa Kirby for my tastes was a bit too annoying as Margaret as well. However, the great things far eclipse the not so good. When 'The Crown' was great, it was the very meaning of a crowning achievement. It couldn't have been any more classy and sumptuous visually. The photography and production and costume design are evocative and a sight to behold. The music for me wasn't too intrusive or low-key and was beautiful scoring on its own. The main theme is not easy to forget. Writing probes a lot of thought and intrigue, it is much more than soap-opera and doesn't feel too modern (not like 'Victoria'). Loved the intimacy and subtle tension of the storytelling in each episode, the deliberate pace in no way a hindrance, and the character chemistry scintillates. The characters are very compellingly written, with enough balance in characterisation to overshadow the instances of one-sidedness and most of them have more than one layer. Cannot find many qualms with the acting. Claire Foy is dignity and class personified and Matt Smith acts every bit as splendidly with lots of authority. One of the biggest standouts of the near-uniformly strong support (Kirby being the exception) is the powerhouse that is John Lithgow, so much so that one can look past misgivings of him not being quite right physically (being too tall for one by nearly a foot, Churchill was not a tall man). Overall, deserving of the acclaim it's garnered. Not quite perfect but really quite wonderful and something of an achievement. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
