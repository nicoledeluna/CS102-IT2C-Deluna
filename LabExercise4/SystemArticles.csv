In recent years, numerous advances in model architectures as well as the development of hybrid models combining machine-learning (ML) with more traditional, physically-motivated, force-field interactions have considerably increased the design space of ML potentials. In this paper, we present FeNNol, a new library for building, training and running force-field-enhanced neural network potentials. It provides a flexible and modular system for building hybrid models, allowing to easily combine state-of-the-art embeddings with ML-parameterized physical interaction terms without the need for explicit programming. Furthermore, FeNNol leverages the automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation features of the Jax Python library to enable fast evaluation of NNPs, shrinking the performance gap between ML potentials and standard force-fields. This is demonstrated with the popular ANI-2x model reaching simulation speeds nearly on par with the AMOEBA polarizable force-field on commodity GPUs (GPU=Graphics processing unit). We hope that FeNNol will facilitate the development and application of new hybrid NNP architectures for a wide range of molecular simulation problems.","Thu, 2 May 2024 17:25:32 UTC (2,347 KB)"
"2","Experimental demonstration of frequency downconverted arm length stabilization for a future upgraded gravitational wave detector","Satoshi Tanioka, Bin Wu, Stefan W. Ballmer","Optics (physics.optics)","Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors consist of complex multiple optical cavity systems. An arm-length stabilization (ALS) system has played an important role in bringing such complex detector into operational state and enhance the duty cycle. The sensitivity of these detectors can be improved if the thermal noise of their test mass mirror coatings is reduced. Crystalline AlGaAs coatings are a promising candidate for this. However, traditional ALS system with frequency-doubled 532 nm light is no longer an option with AlGaAs coatings due to the narrow bandgap of GaAs, thus alternative locking schemes must be developed. In this letter, we describe an experimental demonstration of a novel ALS scheme which is compatible with AlGaAs coatings. This ALS scheme will enable the use of AlGaAs coatings and contribute to improved sensitivity of future detectors.","Thu, 2 May 2024 17:08:11 UTC (930 KB)"

In this work, we demonstrate a new single-rail and dual-rail time-bin shaped photon generator without additional flux-tunable elements, which can act as a quantum interface of a point-to-point quantum network. In our approach, we adopt a qubit-resonator-transmission line configuration, and the effective coupling strength between the qubit and the resonator can be varied by parametrically modulating the qubit frequency. In this way, the coupling is directly proportional to the parametric modulation amplitude and covers a broad tunable range beyond 20 MHz for the sample we used. Additionally, when emitting shaped photons, we find that the spurious frequency shift (-0.4 MHz) due to parametric modulation is small and can be readily calibrated through chirping. We develop an efficient photon field measurement setup based on the data stream processing of GPU. Utilizing this system, we perform photon temporal profile measurement, quantum state tomography of photon field, and quantum process tomography of single-rail quantum state transfer based on a heterodyne measurement scheme. The single-rail encoding state transfer fidelity of shaped photon emission is 90.32%, and that for unshaped photon is 97.20%, respectively. We believe that the fidelity of shaped photon emission is mainly limited by the qubit coherence time. The results demonstrate that our method is hardware efficient, simple to implement, and scalable. It could become a viable tool in a high-quality quantum network utilizing both single-rail and dual-rail time-bin encoding.","Thu, 2 May 2024 16:53:54 UTC (1,597 KB)"

We propose an approach for the unsupervised discovery of flows from dialogue history, thus making the process applicable to any domain for which such an history is available. Briefly, utterances are represented in a vector space and clustered according to their semantic similarity. Clusters, which can be seen as dialogue states, are then used as the vertices of a transition graph for representing the flows visually. We present concrete examples of flows, discovered from MultiWOZ, a public TOD dataset. We further elaborate on their significance and relevance for the underlying conversations and introduce an automatic validation metric for their assessment. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for extracting meaningful flows from task-oriented conversations.","Thu, 2 May 2024 15:54:36 UTC (873 KB)"

The LGAD with a pixel size of 1.3 mm $\times$ 1.3 mm was used to construct a High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) in ATLAS experiments to solve the pile-up problem.
Meanwhile, the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) also proposes detectors using the LGAD. However, pixel LGAD exhibits higher readout electronics density and cost, which somewhat limits the application of LGADs. To decrease the readout electronics density, the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has designed strip LGADs with larger areas. These strip LGADs are all 19 mm in length but with different widths of 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.3 mm.
This article provides a detailed introduction to the design parameters of these strip LGADs and tests their electrical characteristics, including leakage current, break-down voltage, depletion capacitance, etc.
The timing resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the three strip LGAD sensors were investigated using a beta source test system.
The position resolution parallel to the strip direction was tested and analyzed for the first time using a pico-second laser test system.
Tests have demonstrated that the timing resolution of strip LGADs can reach about 37.5 ps, and position resolution parallel to the strip direction is better than 1 mm.","Thu, 2 May 2024 15:37:02 UTC (3,523 KB)"

Reducing reliance on human-based mission control becomes increasingly critical if we are to increase our rate of solar-system-wide exploration. Recent work has explored AI-based goal-oriented systems to increase the level of autonomy in mission execution. These systems make use of symbolic reasoning managers to make inferences from the state of a spacecraft and a handcrafted knowledge base, enabling autonomous generation of tasks and re-planning. Such systems have proven to be successful in controlled cases, but they are difficult to implement as they require human-crafted ontological models to allow the spacecraft to understand the world. Reinforcement learning has been applied to train robotic agents to pursue a goal. A new architecture for autonomy is called for. This work explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as the high-level control system of a spacecraft. Using a systems engineering approach, this work presents the design and development of an agentic spacecraft controller by leveraging an LLM as a reasoning engine, to evaluate the utility of such an architecture in achieving higher levels of spacecraft autonomy. A series of deep space mission scenarios simulated within the popular game engine Kerbal Space Program (KSP) are used as case studies to evaluate the implementation against the requirements. It is shown the reasoning and planning abilities of present-day LLMs do not scale well as the complexity of a mission increases, but this can be alleviated with adequate prompting frameworks and strategic selection of the agent's level of authority over the host spacecraft. This research evaluates the potential of LLMs in augmenting autonomous decision-making systems for future robotic space applications.","Sat, 13 Apr 2024 03:33:17 UTC (32,522 KB)"

Path-integral-based methods, hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) and quantum analog simulators all require the spectral density of the environment to describe its effect on the system.

This finding highlights yet another challenge to obtaining accurate spectral densities. In the context of quantum information science, we give a simple recipe to adjust the results of analog simulation for this difference assuming both the simulator and the target spectral densities are known.","Thu, 2 May 2024 15:23:22 UTC (183 KB)"
"10","An Advanced Framework for Ultra-Realistic Simulation and Digital Twinning for Autonomous Vehicles","Yuankai He, Hanlin Chen, Weisong Shi","Robotics (cs.RO)","Simulation is a fundamental tool in developing autonomous vehicles, enabling rigorous testing without the logistical and safety challenges associated with real-world trials. As autonomous vehicle technologies evolve and public safety demands increase, advanced, realistic simulation frameworks are critical. Current testing paradigms employ a mix of general-purpose and specialized simulators, such as CARLA and IVRESS, to achieve high-fidelity results. However, these tools often struggle with compatibility due to differing platform, hardware, and software requirements, severely hampering their combined effectiveness. This paper introduces BlueICE, an advanced framework for ultra-realistic simulation and digital twinning, to address these challenges. BlueICE's innovative architecture allows for the decoupling of computing platforms, hardware, and software dependencies while offering researchers customizable testing environments to meet diverse fidelity needs. Key features include containerization to ensure compatibility across different systems, a unified communication bridge for seamless integration of various simulation tools, and synchronized orchestration of input and output across simulators. This framework facilitates the development of sophisticated digital twins for autonomous vehicle testing and sets a new standard in simulation accuracy and flexibility. The paper further explores the application of BlueICE in two distinct case studies: the ICAT indoor testbed and the STAR campus outdoor testbed at the University of Delaware. These case studies demonstrate BlueICE's capability to create sophisticated digital twins for autonomous vehicle testing and underline its potential as a standardized testbed for future autonomous driving technologies.","Thu, 2 May 2024 14:32:07 UTC (1,845 KB)"

Our algorithm takes inspiration from QITE in that the quantum state follows the same normalised trajectory in both algorithms. However, it is our QITE methodology's ability to track the scale of the state vector over time that allows our algorithm to solve differential equations. We demonstrate our methodology with numerical simulations and use it to solve the heat equation in one and two dimensions using six and ten qubits, respectively.","Thu, 2 May 2024 14:20:25 UTC (258 KB)"

Instead of identifying and simulating a Koopman model to predict future outputs, we design a subspace predictive controller in the Koopman space. This allows us to learn the observables minimizing the multi-step output prediction error of the Koopman subspace predictor, preventing the propagation of prediction errors. To avoid losing feasibility of our predictive control scheme due to prediction errors, we compute a terminal cost and terminal set in the Koopman space and we obtain recursive feasibility guarantees through an interpolated initial state. As a third contribution, we introduce a novel regularization cost yielding input-to-state stability guarantees with respect to the prediction error for the resulting closed-loop system. The performance of the developed Koopman data-driven predictive control methodology is illustrated on a nonlinear benchmark example from the literature.","Thu, 2 May 2024 13:54:21 UTC (212 KB)"
"14","Strength and Sensitivity of Land-Atmosphere Interaction","Jun Yin","Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)","The land-atmosphere coupling strength has been defined as the percentage of precipitation variability explained by the variation of soil moisture in the Global Land-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (GLACE). While it is useful to identify global hotspots of land-atmosphere interaction, this coupling strength is different from coupling sensitivity, which directly quantifies how precipitation generation responds to the perturbation of soil moisture and is essential for our understanding of the global water cycle. To disentangle these two quantities, here we theoretically explore the relationships among coupling strength, sensitivity, and soil moisture variances. We use climate model outputs to show that the largest soil moisture variances are located in the transitional climate zones and the variations of soil moisture largely account for the geographical patterns of coupling hotspots. The coupling sensitivity is not necessarily low in non-hotspot regions, which could impose great impacts on the development of extreme climate events. We therefore call for more research attention on coupling sensitivity to improve our understanding of the climate system.","Thu, 2 May 2024 13:49:41 UTC (788 KB)"

The method was developed and deployed for the 40m^3 TPC tracker system of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN, which has a one meter of drift length. The method relies on a low-cost multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC) placed downstream of the TPCs to be monitored. The drift velocity is then determined by matching the reconstructed tracks in the TPC to the hits of the pertinent monitoring chamber, called Geometry Reference Chamber (GRC), which is then used as a differential length scale. An important design requirement on the GRC was minimal added complexity to the existing system, in particular, compatibility with Front-End Electronics (FEE) cards already used to read out the TPCs. Moreover, the GRC system was designed to operate both in large and small particle flux.

In this work, we explore ethnicity alteration and skin tone modification using synthetic face image generation methods to increase the diversity of datasets.

We then make use of existing Generative Adversarial Network-based (GAN) image-to-image translation and manifold learning models to alter the ethnicity from one to another. A systematic analysis is further conducted to assess the suitability of such datasets for FRS by studying the realistic skin-tone representation using Individual Typology Angle (ITA). Further, we also analyze the quality characteristics using existing Face image quality assessment (FIQA) approaches. We then provide a holistic FRS performance analysis using four different systems.

Similar to other wireless communication protocols, throughput and reliability are two key performance metrics in Bluetooth Low Energy communications. However, electromagnetic interference from various sources can heavily affect the performance of wireless devices, leading to dropped throughput and unreliable communication. Therefore, there is a need for both theoretical and practical studies capable of quantifying the BLE communication performance, e.g. throughput and reliability, subject to interference. In this paper, a mathematical model to predict throughput of a BLE connection under interference is derived first, and linked to the reliability model we developed in [1]. After that, extensive practical experiments are performed in various scenarios to sufficiently validate the theoretical results from both models. Finally, the trade-off between throughput and reliability is investigated through the validated models to give some inside properties of BLE communications. The similarity between the theoretical results and the experimental ones highlights the accuracy of the proposed throughput and reliability models. Hence, the two models can be used to explore the performance of various BLE designs or deployments from diverse perspectives.","Thu, 2 May 2024 12:22:06 UTC (2,545 KB)"

First, we show that the angle estimation performance in wireless sensing is fundamentally determined by the array geometry, where the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation is derived as a function of the antennas' positions for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays. Then, for the case of 1D MA array, we obtain a globally optimal solution for the MAs' positions in closed form to minimize the CRB of AoA estimation MSE. While in the case of 2D MA array, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. In particular, for the special case of circular antenna movement region, an optimal solution for the MAs' positions is derived under certain numbers of MAs and circle radii. Thereby, both the lower- and upper-bounds of the min-max CRB are obtained for the antenna movement region with arbitrary shapes. Moreover, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to obtain a locally optimal solution for MAs' positions by iteratively optimizing one between their horizontal and vertical coordinates with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed 1D/2D MA arrays can significantly decrease the CRB of AoA estimation MSE as well as the actual MSE compared to conventional uniform linear arrays (ULAs)/uniform planar arrays (UPAs) with different values of uniform inter-antenna spacing.","Thu, 2 May 2024 11:54:41 UTC (10,173 KB)"

While optimizing satellite gateway placement is crucial for operators to minimize deployment and operating costs, reducing the number of gateways may require more inter-satellite link hops to reach the ground network, thereby increasing latency. Therefore, it is of significant importance to develop a framework that optimizes gateway placement, dynamic routing, and flow management in inter-satellite links to enhance network performance. To this end, we model an optimization problem as a mixed-integer problem with a cost function combining the number of gateways, flow allocation, and traffic latency, allowing satellite operators to set priorities based on their policies. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach effectively reduces the number of active gateways by selecting their most appropriate locations while balancing the trade-off between the number of gateways and traffic latency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of different weights in the cost function on performance through comparative analysis.","Thu, 2 May 2024 10:06:13 UTC (12,721 KB)"

Additionally, it is essential to consider cross-cultural differences in the development of Automated Driving features tailored to different countries. Previous piloting studies have compared and analyzed cross-cultural differences in selected implicit driving cues, but they typically examine only limited countries. However, a comprehensive worldwide comparison and analysis are lacking. This study conducts a thorough review of existing literature, online blogs, and expert insights from diverse countries to investigate cross-cultural disparities in driving behaviors, specifically focusing on implicit cues such as non-verbal communication (e.g., hand gestures, signal lighting, honking), norms, and social expectations. Through comparative analysis, variations in driving cues are illuminated across different cultural contexts.

"27","Faster Learned Sparse Retrieval with Block-Max Pruning","Antonio Mallia, Torten Suel, Nicola Tonellotto","Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","Learned sparse retrieval systems aim to combine the effectiveness of contextualized language models with the scalability of conventional data structures such as inverted indexes. Nevertheless, the indexes generated by these systems exhibit significant deviations from the ones that use traditional retrieval models, leading to a discrepancy in the performance of existing query optimizations that were specifically developed for traditional structures. These disparities arise from structural variations in query and document statistics, including sub-word tokenization, leading to longer queries, smaller vocabularies, and different score distributions within posting lists. This paper introduces Block-Max Pruning (BMP), an innovative dynamic pruning strategy tailored for indexes arising in learned sparse retrieval environments. BMP employs a block filtering mechanism to divide the document space into small, consecutive document ranges, which are then aggregated and sorted on the fly, and fully processed only as necessary, guided by a defined safe early termination criterion or based on approximate retrieval requirements. Through rigorous experimentation, we show that BMP substantially outperforms existing dynamic pruning strategies, offering unparalleled efficiency in safe retrieval contexts and improved tradeoffs between precision and efficiency in approximate retrieval tasks.","Thu, 2 May 2024 09:26:30 UTC (73 KB)"

In recent years, the rapid development of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies have introduced a new platform for watching games. Visualization of sports competitions in VR/AR represents a revolutionary technology, providing audiences with a novel immersive viewing experience. However, there is still a lack of related research in this area. In this work, we present for the first time a comprehensive system for sports competition analysis and real-time visualization on VR/AR platforms. First, we utilize multiview LiDARs and cameras to collect multimodal game data. Subsequently, we propose a framework for multi-player tracking and pose estimation based on a limited amount of supervised data, which extracts precise player positions and movements from point clouds and images. Moreover, we perform avatar modeling of players to obtain their 3D models. Ultimately, using these 3D player data, we conduct competition analysis and real-time visualization on VR/AR. Extensive quantitative experiments demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our multi-player tracking and pose estimation framework. The visualization results showcase the immense potential of our sports visualization system on the domain of watching games on VR/AR devices. The multimodal competition dataset we collected and all related code will be released soon.","Thu, 2 May 2024 09:19:43 UTC (34,211 KB)"

Kunz-Schughart, Steffen Lange, Anja Voss-Böhme","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are advanced cell culture systems for assessing the impact of combinatorial radio(chemo)therapy. They exhibit therapeutically relevant in-vivo-like characteristics from 3D cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to radial pathophysiological gradients related to proliferative activity and nutrient/oxygen supply, altering cellular radioresponse. State-of-the-art assays quantify long-term curative endpoints based on collected brightfield image time series from large treated spheroid populations per irradiation dose and treatment arm. Here, spheroid control probabilities are documented analogous to in-vivo tumor control probabilities based on Kaplan-Meier curves. This analyses require laborious spheroid segmentation of up to 100.000 images per treatment arm to extract relevant structural information from the images, e.g., diameter, area, volume and circularity. While several image analysis algorithms are available for spheroid segmentation, they all focus on compact MCTS with clearly distinguishable outer rim throughout growth. However, treated MCTS may partly be detached and destroyed and are usually obscured by dead cell debris. We successfully train two Fully Convolutional Networks, UNet and HRNet, and optimize their hyperparameters to develop an automatic segmentation for both untreated and treated MCTS. We systematically validate the automatic segmentation on larger, independent data sets of spheroids derived from two human head-and-neck cancer cell lines. We find an excellent overlap between manual and automatic segmentation for most images, quantified by Jaccard indices at around 90%. For images with smaller overlap of the segmentations, we demonstrate that this error is comparable to the variations across segmentations from different biological experts, suggesting that these images represent biologically unclear or ambiguous cases.","Thu, 2 May 2024 09:14:38 UTC (13,014 KB)"

Even when the unknown stochastic disturbance exists, and the time-variant reference trajectory is required, the strict non-overshooting stabilization is still achieved. The control law design is based on a desired second-order sliding mode (2-sliding mode), which successively includes two bounded-gain subsystems. Non-overshooting stability requires that the system gains depend on the initial values of system variables. In order to obtain the global non-overshooting stability, the first subsystem with non-overshooting reachability compresses the initial values of the second subsystem to a given bounded range. By partitioning these initial values, the bounded system gains are determined to satisfy the robust non-overshooting stability. In order to reject the chattering in the controller output, a tanh-function-based sliding mode is developed for the design of smoothed non-overshooting controller. The proposed method is applied to a UAV trajectory tracking when the disturbances and uncertainties exist. The control laws are designed to implement the non-overshooting stabilization in position and attitude. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the flying tests.","Thu, 2 May 2024 08:33:41 UTC (4,352 KB)"

In response, this paper pioneers a strategic roadmap for simulation-based testing of ACPSs, specifically focusing on autonomous systems. Our paper discusses the relevant challenges and obstacles of ACPSs, focusing on test automation and quality assurance, hence advocating for tailored solutions to address the unique demands of autonomous systems. While providing concrete definitions of test cases within simulation environments, we also accentuate the need to create new benchmark assets and the development of automated tools tailored explicitly for autonomous systems in the software engineering community. This paper not only highlights the relevant, pressing issues the software engineering community should focus on (in terms of practices, expected automation, and paradigms), but it also outlines ways to tackle them.

However, the existing prediction methods suffer from low prediction accuracy with the lack of spatial-temporal correlation features related to parking volume, and neglect of flow patterns and correlations between similar parking lots within certain areas. To address these challenges, this study proposes a parking availability prediction framework integrating spatial-temporal deep learning with multi-source data fusion, encompassing traffic demand data from multiple sources (e.g., metro, bus, taxi services), and parking lot data. The framework is based on the Transformer as the spatial-temporal deep learning model and leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones, extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) connected to parking lots. Real-world empirical data was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with different machine learning, deep learning, and traditional statistical models for predicting parking availability. Experimental results reveal that, with the proposed pipeline, the developed Transformer model outperforms other models in terms of various metrics, e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). By fusing multi-source demanding data with spatial-temporal deep learning techniques, this approach offers the potential to develop parking availability prediction systems that furnish more accurate and timely information to both drivers and urban planners, thereby fostering more efficient and sustainable urban mobility.","Thu, 2 May 2024 07:28:27 UTC (540 KB)"

The traditional server-based architecture of ASR also presents privacy concerns, alongside reliability and latency issues due to network dependencies. In contrast, on-device (edge) ASR enhances privacy, boosts performance, and promotes sustainability by effectively balancing energy use and accuracy for specific applications. This study examines the effects of quantization, memory demands, and energy consumption on the performance of various ASR model inference on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. By analyzing WER and transcription speed across models using FP32, FP16, and INT8 quantization on clean and noisy datasets, we highlight the crucial trade-offs between accuracy, speeds, quantization, energy efficiency, and memory needs. We found that changing precision from fp32 to fp16 halves the energy consumption for audio transcription across different models, with minimal performance degradation. A larger model size and number of parameters neither guarantees better resilience to noise, nor predicts the energy consumption for a given transcription load. These, along with several other findings offer novel insights for optimizing ASR systems within energy- and memory-limited environments, crucial for the development of efficient on-device ASR solutions.

In response, we present the IgboAPI dataset, a multi-dialectal Igbo-English dictionary dataset, developed with the aim of enhancing the representation of Igbo dialects. Furthermore, we illustrate the practicality of the IgboAPI dataset through two distinct studies: one focusing on Igbo semantic lexicon and the other on machine translation.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that achieves robust performances while completely eliminating downlink CSIT training and feedback. Specifically, by exploiting partial frequency invariance of channel parameters between the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL), we adopt the 2D-Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-NOMP) algorithm to reconstruct DL CSIT from UL training. Due to inherent discrepancies arising from a carrier frequency difference between two disjoint bands, however, the multi-user interference is inevitable. To overcome this, we propose a precoding method that employs rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and also develop an error covariance matrix (ECM) estimation method by using the observed Fisher information matrix (O-FIM). We find that this ECM estimation is crucial for our precoding design in maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that our method significantly improves the sum SE compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, underscoring the importance of our ECM estimation.","Thu, 2 May 2024 03:33:09 UTC (486 KB)"

To this, end, several methods to reconstruct the density matrix, quantum state tomography protocols, have been developed and tested on photoelectrons ejected from noble gases following absorption of XUV photons from attosecond pulses. It remains a challenge to obtain model-free, single scan protocols that can reconstruct the density matrix with high fidelities. Current methods require extensive measurements or involve complex fitting of the signal. Faithful single-scan reconstructions would be of great help to increase the number of systems that can be studied. We propose a new and more efficient protocol - rainbow-KRAKEN - that is able to reconstruct the continuous variable density matrix of a photoelectron in a single time delay scan. It is based on measuring the coherences of a photoelectron created by absorption of an XUV pulse using a broadband IR probe that is scanned in time and a narrowband IR reference that is temporally fixed to the XUV pulse. We illustrate its performance for a Fano resonance in He as well as mixed states in Ar arising from spin-orbit splitting. We show that the protocol results in excellent fidelities and near-perfect estimation of the purity.","Thu, 2 May 2024 03:15:02 UTC (1,993 KB)"

Dimarogonas","Systems and Control (eess.SY)","This paper studies the controller synthesis problem for nonlinear control systems under linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications using zonotope techniques. A local-to-global control strategy is proposed for the desired specification expressed as an LTL formula. First, a novel approach is developed to divide the state space into finite zonotopes and constrained zonotopes, which are called cells and allowed to intersect with the neighbor cells. Second, from the intersection relation, a graph among all cells is generated to verify the realization of the accepting path for the LTL formula. The realization verification determines if there is a need for the control design, and also results in finite local LTL formulas. Third, once the accepting path is realized, a novel abstraction-based method is derived for the controller design. In particular, we only focus on the cells from the realization verification and approximate each cell thanks to properties of zonotopes. Based on local symbolic models and local LTL formulas, an iterative synthesis algorithm is proposed to design all local abstract controllers, whose existence and combination establish the global controller for the LTL formula. Finally, the proposed framework is illustrated via a path planning problem of mobile robots.","Thu, 2 May 2024 00:44:59 UTC (546 KB)"

Internal structure may introduce a new degree of freedom and qualitatively change the dynamics of interacting particles. For certain conditions, namely for the dilute plasma, description of single-particle dynamics in the focused structured laser beams is the first step and may serve as a good approximation on the way of understanding the global plasma response. Moreover, the general problem of integrability in complex systems starts from consideration of the integrals of motion for a single particle. The primary goal of this work is an understanding of the physics of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) absorption by a single particle in a focused structured light. A theoretical model of the process, including solutions of Maxwell equations with the required accuracy and a high-order perturbative approach to electron motion in external electromagnetic fields, is developed and its predictions are examined with numerical simulations for several exemplary electromagnetic field configurations. In particular, it was found that for the particles distributed initially with the azimuthal symmetry around the beam propagation direction, the transferred OAM has a smallness of the fourth order of the applied field amplitude, and requires an accurate consideration of the temporal laser pulse envelope.","Wed, 1 May 2024 23:33:52 UTC (1,358 KB)"

A fundamental result in the control theory of quantum systems states that the set of achievable evolutions is (dense in) the Lie group corresponding to the Lie algebra generated by the Hamiltonians of the system. Such a dynamical Lie algebra therefore characterizes all the state transitions available for a given system. For the Ising spin periodic chain we characterize such a dynamical Lie algebra and therefore the set of all reachable states. In particular, we prove that the dynamical Lie algebra is a (3n-1)-dimensional Lie sub-algebra of su(2^n) which is a direct sum of a two dimensional center and a (3n-3)-dimensional semisimple Lie subalgebra. This in turn is the direct sum of n-1 Lie algebras isomorphic to su(2) parametrized by the eigenvalues of a fixed matrix. We display the basis for each of these Lie subalgebras. Therefore the problem of control for the Ising spin periodic chain is, modulo the two dimensional center, a problem of simultaneous control of n-1 spin 1/2 particles. In the process of proving this result, we develop some tools which are of general interest for the controllability analysis of quantum systems with symmetry.","Wed, 1 May 2024 23:05:40 UTC (22 KB)"

In addition to a variety of build scheduling and test selection heuristics studied in the past, new artifact-based build technologies like Bazel have built-in support for advanced performance optimizations such as parallel build and incremental build (caching of build results). However, little is known about the extent to which new build technologies like Bazel deliver on their promised benefits, especially for long-build duration projects.
In this study, we collected 383 Bazel projects from GitHub, then studied their parallel and incremental build usage of Bazel in 4 popular CI services, and compared the results with Maven projects. We conducted 3,500 experiments on 383 Bazel projects and analyzed the build logs of a subset of 70 buildable projects to evaluate the performance impact of Bazel's parallel builds. Additionally, we performed 102,232 experiments on the 70 buildable projects' last 100 commits to evaluate Bazel's incremental build performance. Our results show that 31.23% of Bazel projects adopt a CI service but do not use Bazel in the CI service, while for those who do use Bazel in CI, 27.76% of them use other tools to facilitate Bazel's execution. Compared to sequential builds, the median speedups for long-build duration projects are 2.00x, 3.84x, 7.36x, and 12.80x, at parallelism degrees 2, 4, 8, and 16, respectively, even though, compared to a clean build, applying incremental build achieves a median speedup of 4.22x (with a build system tool-independent CI cache) and 4.71x (with a build system tool-specific cache) for long-build duration projects.

Nikolic","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","We develop a Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) for open quantum systems interacting with a dissipative environment and apply it to the spin-boson model as an archetypical example where the environment is composed of a bosonic bath. Prior SKFT developments of this type have been confined to the Markovian regime, as an alternative to a conventional description by the Lindblad quantum master equation (QME) which is a time-local matrix differential equation. Here we combine SKFT with a two-particle irreducible (2PI) action that resums a class of Feynman diagrams to infinite order. We obtain the time-evolution of the spin density matrix in the form of a system of integro-differential equations applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The latter regime--where taking into account memory effects becomes essential--poses a challenge for standard methods when trying to incorporate arbitrary properties of the system, bath, and length of time evolution. The SKFT+2PI-computed time evolution of the spin expectation values in the Markovian regime reproduces the solution of the Lindblad QME, as long as the system-bath coupling in the latter is adjusted by increasing it. In the non-Markovian regime, SKFT+2PI yields a nonperturbative solution that mimics results from both hierarchical equations of motion and tensor networks methods that we employ as benchmarks. Our SKFT+2PI approach can also access challenging cases, such as zero-temperature and sub-Ohmic bath, as well as arbitrary long evolution times. Taking into account favorable numerical cost of solving the integro-differential equations with increasing number of spins, time steps or dimensionality the SKFT+2PI approach offers a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and spintronics in the presence of a variety of (single or multiple) dissipative environments.","Wed, 1 May 2024 17:57:08 UTC (540 KB)"

However, current practices ignore some fundamental issues resulting from young children's developmental readiness, such as the sustained capability to keyboarding, the decomposition of complex tasks to small tasks, the need for intuitive mapping from abstract programming to tangible outcomes, and the limited amount of screen time exposure. To address these issues in this paper, we present a novel methodology with an AI-powered integration platform to effectively teach computational thinking for young children. The system features a hybrid pedagogy that supports both the top-down and bottom-up approach for teaching computational thinking. Young children can describe their desired task in natural language, while the system can respond with an easy-to-understand program consisting of the right level of decomposed sub-tasks. A tangible robot can immediately execute the decomposed program and demonstrate the program's outcomes to young children. The system is equipped with an intelligent chatbot that can interact with young children through natural languages, and children can speak to the chatbot to complete all the needed programming tasks, while the chatbot orchestrates the execution of the program onto the robot. This would completely eliminates the need of keyboards for young children to program. By developing such a system, we aim to make the concept of computational thinking more accessible to young children, fostering a natural understanding of programming concepts without the need of explicit programming skills. Through the interactive experience provided by the robotic agent, our system seeks to engage children in an effective manner, contributing to the field of educational technology for early childhood computer science education.","Wed, 1 May 2024 04:29:21 UTC (6,679 KB)"

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have shown their capabilities in supporting medical decision-making. Embedding LLMs in medical systems is becoming a promising trend in healthcare development. The potential of ChatGPT to address the triage problem in emergency departments has been examined, while few studies have explored its application in outpatient departments. With a focus on streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency for outpatient triage, this study specifically aims to evaluate the consistency of responses provided by ChatGPT in outpatient guidance, including both within-version response analysis and between-version comparisons. For within-version, the results indicate that the internal response consistency for ChatGPT-4.0 is significantly higher than ChatGPT-3.5 (p=0.03) and both have a moderate consistency (71.2% for 4.0 and 59.6% for 3.5) in their top recommendation. However, the between-version consistency is relatively low (mean consistency score=1.43/3, median=1), indicating few recommendations match between the two versions. Also, only 50% top recommendations match perfectly in the comparisons. Interestingly, ChatGPT-3.5 responses are more likely to be complete than those from ChatGPT-4.0 (p=0.02), suggesting possible differences in information processing and response generation between the two versions. The findings offer insights into AI-assisted outpatient operations, while also facilitating the exploration of potentials and limitations of LLMs in healthcare utilization.

In recent years, numerous advances in model architectures as well as the development of hybrid models combining machine-learning (ML) with more traditional, physically-motivated, force-field interactions have considerably increased the design space of ML potentials. In this paper, we present FeNNol, a new library for building, training and running force-field-enhanced neural network potentials. It provides a flexible and modular system for building hybrid models, allowing to easily combine state-of-the-art embeddings with ML-parameterized physical interaction terms without the need for explicit programming. Furthermore, FeNNol leverages the automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation features of the Jax Python library to enable fast evaluation of NNPs, shrinking the performance gap between ML potentials and standard force-fields. This is demonstrated with the popular ANI-2x model reaching simulation speeds nearly on par with the AMOEBA polarizable force-field on commodity GPUs (GPU=Graphics processing unit). We hope that FeNNol will facilitate the development and application of new hybrid NNP architectures for a wide range of molecular simulation problems.","Thu, 2 May 2024 17:25:32 UTC (2,347 KB)"

Ballmer","Optics (physics.optics)","Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors consist of complex multiple optical cavity systems. An arm-length stabilization (ALS) system has played an important role in bringing such complex detector into operational state and enhance the duty cycle. The sensitivity of these detectors can be improved if the thermal noise of their test mass mirror coatings is reduced. Crystalline AlGaAs coatings are a promising candidate for this. However, traditional ALS system with frequency-doubled 532 nm light is no longer an option with AlGaAs coatings due to the narrow bandgap of GaAs, thus alternative locking schemes must be developed. In this letter, we describe an experimental demonstration of a novel ALS scheme which is compatible with AlGaAs coatings. This ALS scheme will enable the use of AlGaAs coatings and contribute to improved sensitivity of future detectors.","Thu, 2 May 2024 17:08:11 UTC (930 KB)"

In this work, we demonstrate a new single-rail and dual-rail time-bin shaped photon generator without additional flux-tunable elements, which can act as a quantum interface of a point-to-point quantum network. In our approach, we adopt a qubit-resonator-transmission line configuration, and the effective coupling strength between the qubit and the resonator can be varied by parametrically modulating the qubit frequency. In this way, the coupling is directly proportional to the parametric modulation amplitude and covers a broad tunable range beyond 20 MHz for the sample we used. Additionally, when emitting shaped photons, we find that the spurious frequency shift (-0.4 MHz) due to parametric modulation is small and can be readily calibrated through chirping. We develop an efficient photon field measurement setup based on the data stream processing of GPU. Utilizing this system, we perform photon temporal profile measurement, quantum state tomography of photon field, and quantum process tomography of single-rail quantum state transfer based on a heterodyne measurement scheme. The single-rail encoding state transfer fidelity of shaped photon emission is 90.32%, and that for unshaped photon is 97.20%, respectively. We believe that the fidelity of shaped photon emission is mainly limited by the qubit coherence time. The results demonstrate that our method is hardware efficient, simple to implement, and scalable. It could become a viable tool in a high-quality quantum network utilizing both single-rail and dual-rail time-bin encoding.","Thu, 2 May 2024 16:53:54 UTC (1,597 KB)"

The LGAD with a pixel size of 1.3 mm $\times$ 1.3 mm was used to construct a High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) in ATLAS experiments to solve the pile-up problem.
Meanwhile, the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) also proposes detectors using the LGAD. However, pixel LGAD exhibits higher readout electronics density and cost, which somewhat limits the application of LGADs. To decrease the readout electronics density, the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has designed strip LGADs with larger areas. These strip LGADs are all 19 mm in length but with different widths of 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.3 mm.
This article provides a detailed introduction to the design parameters of these strip LGADs and tests their electrical characteristics, including leakage current, break-down voltage, depletion capacitance, etc.
The timing resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the three strip LGAD sensors were investigated using a beta source test system.
The position resolution parallel to the strip direction was tested and analyzed for the first time using a pico-second laser test system.

Reducing reliance on human-based mission control becomes increasingly critical if we are to increase our rate of solar-system-wide exploration. Recent work has explored AI-based goal-oriented systems to increase the level of autonomy in mission execution. These systems make use of symbolic reasoning managers to make inferences from the state of a spacecraft and a handcrafted knowledge base, enabling autonomous generation of tasks and re-planning. Such systems have proven to be successful in controlled cases, but they are difficult to implement as they require human-crafted ontological models to allow the spacecraft to understand the world. Reinforcement learning has been applied to train robotic agents to pursue a goal. A new architecture for autonomy is called for. This work explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as the high-level control system of a spacecraft. Using a systems engineering approach, this work presents the design and development of an agentic spacecraft controller by leveraging an LLM as a reasoning engine, to evaluate the utility of such an architecture in achieving higher levels of spacecraft autonomy. A series of deep space mission scenarios simulated within the popular game engine Kerbal Space Program (KSP) are used as case studies to evaluate the implementation against the requirements. It is shown the reasoning and planning abilities of present-day LLMs do not scale well as the complexity of a mission increases, but this can be alleviated with adequate prompting frameworks and strategic selection of the agent's level of authority over the host spacecraft. This research evaluates the potential of LLMs in augmenting autonomous decision-making systems for future robotic space applications.","Sat, 13 Apr 2024 03:33:17 UTC (32,522 KB)"

As autonomous vehicle technologies evolve and public safety demands increase, advanced, realistic simulation frameworks are critical. Current testing paradigms employ a mix of general-purpose and specialized simulators, such as CARLA and IVRESS, to achieve high-fidelity results. However, these tools often struggle with compatibility due to differing platform, hardware, and software requirements, severely hampering their combined effectiveness. This paper introduces BlueICE, an advanced framework for ultra-realistic simulation and digital twinning, to address these challenges. BlueICE's innovative architecture allows for the decoupling of computing platforms, hardware, and software dependencies while offering researchers customizable testing environments to meet diverse fidelity needs. Key features include containerization to ensure compatibility across different systems, a unified communication bridge for seamless integration of various simulation tools, and synchronized orchestration of input and output across simulators. This framework facilitates the development of sophisticated digital twins for autonomous vehicle testing and sets a new standard in simulation accuracy and flexibility. The paper further explores the application of BlueICE in two distinct case studies: the ICAT indoor testbed and the STAR campus outdoor testbed at the University of Delaware. These case studies demonstrate BlueICE's capability to create sophisticated digital twins for autonomous vehicle testing and underline its potential as a standardized testbed for future autonomous driving technologies.","Thu, 2 May 2024 14:32:07 UTC (1,845 KB)"

Instead of identifying and simulating a Koopman model to predict future outputs, we design a subspace predictive controller in the Koopman space. This allows us to learn the observables minimizing the multi-step output prediction error of the Koopman subspace predictor, preventing the propagation of prediction errors. To avoid losing feasibility of our predictive control scheme due to prediction errors, we compute a terminal cost and terminal set in the Koopman space and we obtain recursive feasibility guarantees through an interpolated initial state. As a third contribution, we introduce a novel regularization cost yielding input-to-state stability guarantees with respect to the prediction error for the resulting closed-loop system. The performance of the developed Koopman data-driven predictive control methodology is illustrated on a nonlinear benchmark example from the literature.","Thu, 2 May 2024 13:54:21 UTC (212 KB)"

While it is useful to identify global hotspots of land-atmosphere interaction, this coupling strength is different from coupling sensitivity, which directly quantifies how precipitation generation responds to the perturbation of soil moisture and is essential for our understanding of the global water cycle. To disentangle these two quantities, here we theoretically explore the relationships among coupling strength, sensitivity, and soil moisture variances. We use climate model outputs to show that the largest soil moisture variances are located in the transitional climate zones and the variations of soil moisture largely account for the geographical patterns of coupling hotspots. The coupling sensitivity is not necessarily low in non-hotspot regions, which could impose great impacts on the development of extreme climate events. We therefore call for more research attention on coupling sensitivity to improve our understanding of the climate system.","Thu, 2 May 2024 13:49:41 UTC (788 KB)"

The method relies on a low-cost multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC) placed downstream of the TPCs to be monitored.

First, we show that the angle estimation performance in wireless sensing is fundamentally determined by the array geometry, where the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation is derived as a function of the antennas' positions for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays. Then, for the case of 1D MA array, we obtain a globally optimal solution for the MAs' positions in closed form to minimize the CRB of AoA estimation MSE. While in the case of 2D MA array, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. In particular, for the special case of circular antenna movement region, an optimal solution for the MAs' positions is derived under certain numbers of MAs and circle radii. Thereby, both the lower- and upper-bounds of the min-max CRB are obtained for the antenna movement region with arbitrary shapes. Moreover, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to obtain a locally optimal solution for MAs' positions by iteratively optimizing one between their horizontal and vertical coordinates with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed 1D/2D MA arrays can significantly decrease the CRB of AoA estimation MSE as well as the actual MSE compared to conventional uniform linear arrays (ULAs)/uniform planar arrays (UPAs) with different values of uniform inter-antenna spacing.","Thu, 2 May 2024 11:54:41 UTC (10,173 KB)"

While optimizing satellite gateway placement is crucial for operators to minimize deployment and operating costs, reducing the number of gateways may require more inter-satellite link hops to reach the ground network, thereby increasing latency. Therefore, it is of significant importance to develop a framework that optimizes gateway placement, dynamic routing, and flow management in inter-satellite links to enhance network performance. To this end, we model an optimization problem as a mixed-integer problem with a cost function combining the number of gateways, flow allocation, and traffic latency, allowing satellite operators to set priorities based on their policies. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach effectively reduces the number of active gateways by selecting their most appropriate locations while balancing the trade-off between the number of gateways and traffic latency.

Additionally, it is essential to consider cross-cultural differences in the development of Automated Driving features tailored to different countries. Previous piloting studies have compared and analyzed cross-cultural differences in selected implicit driving cues, but they typically examine only limited countries. However, a comprehensive worldwide comparison and analysis are lacking. This study conducts a thorough review of existing literature, online blogs, and expert insights from diverse countries to investigate cross-cultural disparities in driving behaviors, specifically focusing on implicit cues such as non-verbal communication (e.g., hand gestures, signal lighting, honking), norms, and social expectations. Through comparative analysis, variations in driving cues are illuminated across different cultural contexts. Based on the findings and identified gaps, a research roadmap is proposed for future research to further explore and address these differences, aiming to enhance intercultural communication, improve road safety, and increase transportation efficiency on a global scale. This paper presents the pioneering work towards a comprehensive understanding of the implicit driving cues across cultures. Moreover, this understanding will inform the development of automated driving systems tailored to different countries considering cross-cultural differences.","Thu, 2 May 2024 09:30:08 UTC (222 KB)"
"77","Faster Learned Sparse Retrieval with Block-Max Pruning","Antonio Mallia, Torten Suel, Nicola Tonellotto","Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","Learned sparse retrieval systems aim to combine the effectiveness of contextualized language models with the scalability of conventional data structures such as inverted indexes. Nevertheless, the indexes generated by these systems exhibit significant deviations from the ones that use traditional retrieval models, leading to a discrepancy in the performance of existing query optimizations that were specifically developed for traditional structures. These disparities arise from structural variations in query and document statistics, including sub-word tokenization, leading to longer queries, smaller vocabularies, and different score distributions within posting lists. This paper introduces Block-Max Pruning (BMP), an innovative dynamic pruning strategy tailored for indexes arising in learned sparse retrieval environments. BMP employs a block filtering mechanism to divide the document space into small, consecutive document ranges, which are then aggregated and sorted on the fly, and fully processed only as necessary, guided by a defined safe early termination criterion or based on approximate retrieval requirements. Through rigorous experimentation, we show that BMP substantially outperforms existing dynamic pruning strategies, offering unparalleled efficiency in safe retrieval contexts and improved tradeoffs between precision and efficiency in approximate retrieval tasks.","Thu, 2 May 2024 09:26:30 UTC (73 KB)"

In recent years, the rapid development of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies have introduced a new platform for watching games. Visualization of sports competitions in VR/AR represents a revolutionary technology, providing audiences with a novel immersive viewing experience. However, there is still a lack of related research in this area. In this work, we present for the first time a comprehensive system for sports competition analysis and real-time visualization on VR/AR platforms. First, we utilize multiview LiDARs and cameras to collect multimodal game data. Subsequently, we propose a framework for multi-player tracking and pose estimation based on a limited amount of supervised data, which extracts precise player positions and movements from point clouds and images. Moreover, we perform avatar modeling of players to obtain their 3D models. Ultimately, using these 3D player data, we conduct competition analysis and real-time visualization on VR/AR. Extensive quantitative experiments demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our multi-player tracking and pose estimation framework. The visualization results showcase the immense potential of our sports visualization system on the domain of watching games on VR/AR devices.

Kunz-Schughart, Steffen Lange, Anja Voss-Böhme","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are advanced cell culture systems for assessing the impact of combinatorial radio(chemo)therapy. They exhibit therapeutically relevant in-vivo-like characteristics from 3D cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to radial pathophysiological gradients related to proliferative activity and nutrient/oxygen supply, altering cellular radioresponse. State-of-the-art assays quantify long-term curative endpoints based on collected brightfield image time series from large treated spheroid populations per irradiation dose and treatment arm. Here, spheroid control probabilities are documented analogous to in-vivo tumor control probabilities based on Kaplan-Meier curves. This analyses require laborious spheroid segmentation of up to 100.000 images per treatment arm to extract relevant structural information from the images, e.g., diameter, area, volume and circularity. While several image analysis algorithms are available for spheroid segmentation, they all focus on compact MCTS with clearly distinguishable outer rim throughout growth. However, treated MCTS may partly be detached and destroyed and are usually obscured by dead cell debris. We successfully train two Fully Convolutional Networks, UNet and HRNet, and optimize their hyperparameters to develop an automatic segmentation for both untreated and treated MCTS. We systematically validate the automatic segmentation on larger, independent data sets of spheroids derived from two human head-and-neck cancer cell lines. We find an excellent overlap between manual and automatic segmentation for most images, quantified by Jaccard indices at around 90%. For images with smaller overlap of the segmentations, we demonstrate that this error is comparable to the variations across segmentations from different biological experts, suggesting that these images represent biologically unclear or ambiguous cases.","Thu, 2 May 2024 09:14:38 UTC (13,014 KB)"

Even when the unknown stochastic disturbance exists, and the time-variant reference trajectory is required, the strict non-overshooting stabilization is still achieved. The control law design is based on a desired second-order sliding mode (2-sliding mode), which successively includes two bounded-gain subsystems. Non-overshooting stability requires that the system gains depend on the initial values of system variables. In order to obtain the global non-overshooting stability, the first subsystem with non-overshooting reachability compresses the initial values of the second subsystem to a given bounded range. By partitioning these initial values, the bounded system gains are determined to satisfy the robust non-overshooting stability. In order to reject the chattering in the controller output, a tanh-function-based sliding mode is developed for the design of smoothed non-overshooting controller. The proposed method is applied to a UAV trajectory tracking when the disturbances and uncertainties exist. The control laws are designed to implement the non-overshooting stabilization in position and attitude. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the flying tests.","Thu, 2 May 2024 08:33:41 UTC (4,352 KB)"

However, the existing prediction methods suffer from low prediction accuracy with the lack of spatial-temporal correlation features related to parking volume, and neglect of flow patterns and correlations between similar parking lots within certain areas. To address these challenges, this study proposes a parking availability prediction framework integrating spatial-temporal deep learning with multi-source data fusion, encompassing traffic demand data from multiple sources (e.g., metro, bus, taxi services), and parking lot data. The framework is based on the Transformer as the spatial-temporal deep learning model and leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones, extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) connected to parking lots. Real-world empirical data was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with different machine learning, deep learning, and traditional statistical models for predicting parking availability. Experimental results reveal that, with the proposed pipeline, the developed Transformer model outperforms other models in terms of various metrics, e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). By fusing multi-source demanding data with spatial-temporal deep learning techniques, this approach offers the potential to develop parking availability prediction systems that furnish more accurate and timely information to both drivers and urban planners, thereby fostering more efficient and sustainable urban mobility.","Thu, 2 May 2024 07:28:27 UTC (540 KB)"

The traditional server-based architecture of ASR also presents privacy concerns, alongside reliability and latency issues due to network dependencies. In contrast, on-device (edge) ASR enhances privacy, boosts performance, and promotes sustainability by effectively balancing energy use and accuracy for specific applications. This study examines the effects of quantization, memory demands, and energy consumption on the performance of various ASR model inference on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. By analyzing WER and transcription speed across models using FP32, FP16, and INT8 quantization on clean and noisy datasets, we highlight the crucial trade-offs between accuracy, speeds, quantization, energy efficiency, and memory needs. We found that changing precision from fp32 to fp16 halves the energy consumption for audio transcription across different models, with minimal performance degradation. A larger model size and number of parameters neither guarantees better resilience to noise, nor predicts the energy consumption for a given transcription load. These, along with several other findings offer novel insights for optimizing ASR systems within energy- and memory-limited environments, crucial for the development of efficient on-device ASR solutions.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that achieves robust performances while completely eliminating downlink CSIT training and feedback. Specifically, by exploiting partial frequency invariance of channel parameters between the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL), we adopt the 2D-Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-NOMP) algorithm to reconstruct DL CSIT from UL training. Due to inherent discrepancies arising from a carrier frequency difference between two disjoint bands, however, the multi-user interference is inevitable. To overcome this, we propose a precoding method that employs rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and also develop an error covariance matrix (ECM) estimation method by using the observed Fisher information matrix (O-FIM). We find that this ECM estimation is crucial for our precoding design in maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that our method significantly improves the sum SE compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, underscoring the importance of our ECM estimation.","Thu, 2 May 2024 03:33:09 UTC (486 KB)"

To this, end, several methods to reconstruct the density matrix, quantum state tomography protocols, have been developed and tested on photoelectrons ejected from noble gases following absorption of XUV photons from attosecond pulses. It remains a challenge to obtain model-free, single scan protocols that can reconstruct the density matrix with high fidelities. Current methods require extensive measurements or involve complex fitting of the signal. Faithful single-scan reconstructions would be of great help to increase the number of systems that can be studied. We propose a new and more efficient protocol - rainbow-KRAKEN - that is able to reconstruct the continuous variable density matrix of a photoelectron in a single time delay scan. It is based on measuring the coherences of a photoelectron created by absorption of an XUV pulse using a broadband IR probe that is scanned in time and a narrowband IR reference that is temporally fixed to the XUV pulse. We illustrate its performance for a Fano resonance in He as well as mixed states in Ar arising from spin-orbit splitting. We show that the protocol results in excellent fidelities and near-perfect estimation of the purity.","Thu, 2 May 2024 03:15:02 UTC (1,993 KB)"

Dimarogonas","Systems and Control (eess.SY)","This paper studies the controller synthesis problem for nonlinear control systems under linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications using zonotope techniques. A local-to-global control strategy is proposed for the desired specification expressed as an LTL formula. First, a novel approach is developed to divide the state space into finite zonotopes and constrained zonotopes, which are called cells and allowed to intersect with the neighbor cells. Second, from the intersection relation, a graph among all cells is generated to verify the realization of the accepting path for the LTL formula. The realization verification determines if there is a need for the control design, and also results in finite local LTL formulas. Third, once the accepting path is realized, a novel abstraction-based method is derived for the controller design. In particular, we only focus on the cells from the realization verification and approximate each cell thanks to properties of zonotopes. Based on local symbolic models and local LTL formulas, an iterative synthesis algorithm is proposed to design all local abstract controllers, whose existence and combination establish the global controller for the LTL formula. Finally, the proposed framework is illustrated via a path planning problem of mobile robots.","Thu, 2 May 2024 00:44:59 UTC (546 KB)"

Internal structure may introduce a new degree of freedom and qualitatively change the dynamics of interacting particles. For certain conditions, namely for the dilute plasma, description of single-particle dynamics in the focused structured laser beams is the first step and may serve as a good approximation on the way of understanding the global plasma response. Moreover, the general problem of integrability in complex systems starts from consideration of the integrals of motion for a single particle. The primary goal of this work is an understanding of the physics of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) absorption by a single particle in a focused structured light. A theoretical model of the process, including solutions of Maxwell equations with the required accuracy and a high-order perturbative approach to electron motion in external electromagnetic fields, is developed and its predictions are examined with numerical simulations for several exemplary electromagnetic field configurations. In particular, it was found that for the particles distributed initially with the azimuthal symmetry around the beam propagation direction, the transferred OAM has a smallness of the fourth order of the applied field amplitude, and requires an accurate consideration of the temporal laser pulse envelope.","Wed, 1 May 2024 23:33:52 UTC (1,358 KB)"

A fundamental result in the control theory of quantum systems states that the set of achievable evolutions is (dense in) the Lie group corresponding to the Lie algebra generated by the Hamiltonians of the system. Such a dynamical Lie algebra therefore characterizes all the state transitions available for a given system. For the Ising spin periodic chain we characterize such a dynamical Lie algebra and therefore the set of all reachable states. In particular, we prove that the dynamical Lie algebra is a (3n-1)-dimensional Lie sub-algebra of su(2^n) which is a direct sum of a two dimensional center and a (3n-3)-dimensional semisimple Lie subalgebra. This in turn is the direct sum of n-1 Lie algebras isomorphic to su(2) parametrized by the eigenvalues of a fixed matrix. We display the basis for each of these Lie subalgebras. Therefore the problem of control for the Ising spin periodic chain is, modulo the two dimensional center, a problem of simultaneous control of n-1 spin 1/2 particles. In the process of proving this result, we develop some tools which are of general interest for the controllability analysis of quantum systems with symmetry.","Wed, 1 May 2024 23:05:40 UTC (22 KB)"

In addition to a variety of build scheduling and test selection heuristics studied in the past, new artifact-based build technologies like Bazel have built-in support for advanced performance optimizations such as parallel build and incremental build (caching of build results). However, little is known about the extent to which new build technologies like Bazel deliver on their promised benefits, especially for long-build duration projects.
In this study, we collected 383 Bazel projects from GitHub, then studied their parallel and incremental build usage of Bazel in 4 popular CI services, and compared the results with Maven projects. We conducted 3,500 experiments on 383 Bazel projects and analyzed the build logs of a subset of 70 buildable projects to evaluate the performance impact of Bazel's parallel builds. Additionally, we performed 102,232 experiments on the 70 buildable projects' last 100 commits to evaluate Bazel's incremental build performance. Our results show that 31.23% of Bazel projects adopt a CI service but do not use Bazel in the CI service, while for those who do use Bazel in CI, 27.76% of them use other tools to facilitate Bazel's execution. Compared to sequential builds, the median speedups for long-build duration projects are 2.00x, 3.84x, 7.36x, and 12.80x, at parallelism degrees 2, 4, 8, and 16, respectively, even though, compared to a clean build, applying incremental build achieves a median speedup of 4.22x (with a build system tool-independent CI cache) and 4.71x (with a build system tool-specific cache) for long-build duration projects.

Nikolic","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","We develop a Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) for open quantum systems interacting with a dissipative environment and apply it to the spin-boson model as an archetypical example where the environment is composed of a bosonic bath. Prior SKFT developments of this type have been confined to the Markovian regime, as an alternative to a conventional description by the Lindblad quantum master equation (QME) which is a time-local matrix differential equation. Here we combine SKFT with a two-particle irreducible (2PI) action that resums a class of Feynman diagrams to infinite order. We obtain the time-evolution of the spin density matrix in the form of a system of integro-differential equations applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The latter regime--where taking into account memory effects becomes essential--poses a challenge for standard methods when trying to incorporate arbitrary properties of the system, bath, and length of time evolution. The SKFT+2PI-computed time evolution of the spin expectation values in the Markovian regime reproduces the solution of the Lindblad QME, as long as the system-bath coupling in the latter is adjusted by increasing it. In the non-Markovian regime, SKFT+2PI yields a nonperturbative solution that mimics results from both hierarchical equations of motion and tensor networks methods that we employ as benchmarks. Our SKFT+2PI approach can also access challenging cases, such as zero-temperature and sub-Ohmic bath, as well as arbitrary long evolution times. Taking into account favorable numerical cost of solving the integro-differential equations with increasing number of spins, time steps or dimensionality the SKFT+2PI approach offers a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and spintronics in the presence of a variety of (single or multiple) dissipative environments.","Wed, 1 May 2024 17:57:08 UTC (540 KB)"

However, current practices ignore some fundamental issues resulting from young children's developmental readiness, such as the sustained capability to keyboarding, the decomposition of complex tasks to small tasks, the need for intuitive mapping from abstract programming to tangible outcomes, and the limited amount of screen time exposure. To address these issues in this paper, we present a novel methodology with an AI-powered integration platform to effectively teach computational thinking for young children. The system features a hybrid pedagogy that supports both the top-down and bottom-up approach for teaching computational thinking. Young children can describe their desired task in natural language, while the system can respond with an easy-to-understand program consisting of the right level of decomposed sub-tasks. A tangible robot can immediately execute the decomposed program and demonstrate the program's outcomes to young children. The system is equipped with an intelligent chatbot that can interact with young children through natural languages, and children can speak to the chatbot to complete all the needed programming tasks, while the chatbot orchestrates the execution of the program onto the robot. This would completely eliminates the need of keyboards for young children to program. By developing such a system, we aim to make the concept of computational thinking more accessible to young children, fostering a natural understanding of programming concepts without the need of explicit programming skills. Through the interactive experience provided by the robotic agent, our system seeks to engage children in an effective manner, contributing to the field of educational technology for early childhood computer science education.","Wed, 1 May 2024 04:29:21 UTC (6,679 KB)"

For within-version, the results indicate that the internal response consistency for ChatGPT-4.0 is significantly higher than ChatGPT-3.5 (p=0.03) and both have a moderate consistency (71.2% for 4.0 and 59.6% for 3.5) in their top recommendation. However, the between-version consistency is relatively low (mean consistency score=1.43/3, median=1), indicating few recommendations match between the two versions. Also, only 50% top recommendations match perfectly in the comparisons. Interestingly, ChatGPT-3.5 responses are more likely to be complete than those from ChatGPT-4.0 (p=0.02), suggesting possible differences in information processing and response generation between the two versions. The findings offer insights into AI-assisted outpatient operations, while also facilitating the exploration of potentials and limitations of LLMs in healthcare utilization. Future research may focus on carefully optimizing LLMs and AI integration in healthcare systems based on ergonomic and human factors principles, precisely aligning with the specific needs of effective outpatient triage.","Sat, 27 Apr 2024 04:12:02 UTC (432 KB)"

In recent years, numerous advances in model architectures as well as the development of hybrid models combining machine-learning (ML) with more traditional, physically-motivated, force-field interactions have considerably increased the design space of ML potentials. In this paper, we present FeNNol, a new library for building, training and running force-field-enhanced neural network potentials. It provides a flexible and modular system for building hybrid models, allowing to easily combine state-of-the-art embeddings with ML-parameterized physical interaction terms without the need for explicit programming. Furthermore, FeNNol leverages the automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation features of the Jax Python library to enable fast evaluation of NNPs, shrinking the performance gap between ML potentials and standard force-fields. This is demonstrated with the popular ANI-2x model reaching simulation speeds nearly on par with the AMOEBA polarizable force-field on commodity GPUs (GPU=Graphics processing unit). We hope that FeNNol will facilitate the development and application of new hybrid NNP architectures for a wide range of molecular simulation problems.","Thu, 2 May 2024 17:25:32 UTC (2,347 KB)"

An arm-length stabilization (ALS) system has played an important role in bringing such complex detector into operational state and enhance the duty cycle. The sensitivity of these detectors can be improved if the thermal noise of their test mass mirror coatings is reduced. Crystalline AlGaAs coatings are a promising candidate for this. However, traditional ALS system with frequency-doubled 532 nm light is no longer an option with AlGaAs coatings due to the narrow bandgap of GaAs, thus alternative locking schemes must be developed. In this letter, we describe an experimental demonstration of a novel ALS scheme which is compatible with AlGaAs coatings. This ALS scheme will enable the use of AlGaAs coatings and contribute to improved sensitivity of future detectors.","Thu, 2 May 2024 17:08:11 UTC (930 KB)"

In this work, we demonstrate a new single-rail and dual-rail time-bin shaped photon generator without additional flux-tunable elements, which can act as a quantum interface of a point-to-point quantum network. In our approach, we adopt a qubit-resonator-transmission line configuration, and the effective coupling strength between the qubit and the resonator can be varied by parametrically modulating the qubit frequency. In this way, the coupling is directly proportional to the parametric modulation amplitude and covers a broad tunable range beyond 20 MHz for the sample we used. Additionally, when emitting shaped photons, we find that the spurious frequency shift (-0.4 MHz) due to parametric modulation is small and can be readily calibrated through chirping. We develop an efficient photon field measurement setup based on the data stream processing of GPU. Utilizing this system, we perform photon temporal profile measurement, quantum state tomography of photon field, and quantum process tomography of single-rail quantum state transfer based on a heterodyne measurement scheme. The single-rail encoding state transfer fidelity of shaped photon emission is 90.32%, and that for unshaped photon is 97.20%, respectively. We believe that the fidelity of shaped photon emission is mainly limited by the qubit coherence time. The results demonstrate that our method is hardware efficient, simple to implement, and scalable. It could become a viable tool in a high-quality quantum network utilizing both single-rail and dual-rail time-bin encoding.","Thu, 2 May 2024 16:53:54 UTC (1,597 KB)"

Meanwhile, the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) also proposes detectors using the LGAD. However, pixel LGAD exhibits higher readout electronics density and cost, which somewhat limits the application of LGADs. To decrease the readout electronics density, the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has designed strip LGADs with larger areas. These strip LGADs are all 19 mm in length but with different widths of 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.3 mm.
This article provides a detailed introduction to the design parameters of these strip LGADs and tests their electrical characteristics, including leakage current, break-down voltage, depletion capacitance, etc.
The timing resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the three strip LGAD sensors were investigated using a beta source test system.

Reducing reliance on human-based mission control becomes increasingly critical if we are to increase our rate of solar-system-wide exploration. Recent work has explored AI-based goal-oriented systems to increase the level of autonomy in mission execution. These systems make use of symbolic reasoning managers to make inferences from the state of a spacecraft and a handcrafted knowledge base, enabling autonomous generation of tasks and re-planning. Such systems have proven to be successful in controlled cases, but they are difficult to implement as they require human-crafted ontological models to allow the spacecraft to understand the world. Reinforcement learning has been applied to train robotic agents to pursue a goal. A new architecture for autonomy is called for. This work explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as the high-level control system of a spacecraft. Using a systems engineering approach, this work presents the design and development of an agentic spacecraft controller by leveraging an LLM as a reasoning engine, to evaluate the utility of such an architecture in achieving higher levels of spacecraft autonomy. A series of deep space mission scenarios simulated within the popular game engine Kerbal Space Program (KSP) are used as case studies to evaluate the implementation against the requirements. It is shown the reasoning and planning abilities of present-day LLMs do not scale well as the complexity of a mission increases, but this can be alleviated with adequate prompting frameworks and strategic selection of the agent's level of authority over the host spacecraft. This research evaluates the potential of LLMs in augmenting autonomous decision-making systems for future robotic space applications.","Sat, 13 Apr 2024 03:33:17 UTC (32,522 KB)"

As autonomous vehicle technologies evolve and public safety demands increase, advanced, realistic simulation frameworks are critical. Current testing paradigms employ a mix of general-purpose and specialized simulators, such as CARLA and IVRESS, to achieve high-fidelity results. However, these tools often struggle with compatibility due to differing platform, hardware, and software requirements, severely hampering their combined effectiveness. This paper introduces BlueICE, an advanced framework for ultra-realistic simulation and digital twinning, to address these challenges. BlueICE's innovative architecture allows for the decoupling of computing platforms, hardware, and software dependencies while offering researchers customizable testing environments to meet diverse fidelity needs. Key features include containerization to ensure compatibility across different systems, a unified communication bridge for seamless integration of various simulation tools, and synchronized orchestration of input and output across simulators. This framework facilitates the development of sophisticated digital twins for autonomous vehicle testing and sets a new standard in simulation accuracy and flexibility. The paper further explores the application of BlueICE in two distinct case studies: the ICAT indoor testbed and the STAR campus outdoor testbed at the University of Delaware. These case studies demonstrate BlueICE's capability to create sophisticated digital twins for autonomous vehicle testing and underline its potential as a standardized testbed for future autonomous driving technologies.","Thu, 2 May 2024 14:32:07 UTC (1,845 KB)"

Instead of identifying and simulating a Koopman model to predict future outputs, we design a subspace predictive controller in the Koopman space. This allows us to learn the observables minimizing the multi-step output prediction error of the Koopman subspace predictor, preventing the propagation of prediction errors. To avoid losing feasibility of our predictive control scheme due to prediction errors, we compute a terminal cost and terminal set in the Koopman space and we obtain recursive feasibility guarantees through an interpolated initial state. As a third contribution, we introduce a novel regularization cost yielding input-to-state stability guarantees with respect to the prediction error for the resulting closed-loop system. The performance of the developed Koopman data-driven predictive control methodology is illustrated on a nonlinear benchmark example from the literature.","Thu, 2 May 2024 13:54:21 UTC (212 KB)"

While it is useful to identify global hotspots of land-atmosphere interaction, this coupling strength is different from coupling sensitivity, which directly quantifies how precipitation generation responds to the perturbation of soil moisture and is essential for our understanding of the global water cycle. To disentangle these two quantities, here we theoretically explore the relationships among coupling strength, sensitivity, and soil moisture variances. We use climate model outputs to show that the largest soil moisture variances are located in the transitional climate zones and the variations of soil moisture largely account for the geographical patterns of coupling hotspots. The coupling sensitivity is not necessarily low in non-hotspot regions, which could impose great impacts on the development of extreme climate events. We therefore call for more research attention on coupling sensitivity to improve our understanding of the climate system.","Thu, 2 May 2024 13:49:41 UTC (788 KB)"

First, we show that the angle estimation performance in wireless sensing is fundamentally determined by the array geometry, where the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation is derived as a function of the antennas' positions for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays. Then, for the case of 1D MA array, we obtain a globally optimal solution for the MAs' positions in closed form to minimize the CRB of AoA estimation MSE. While in the case of 2D MA array, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. In particular, for the special case of circular antenna movement region, an optimal solution for the MAs' positions is derived under certain numbers of MAs and circle radii. Thereby, both the lower- and upper-bounds of the min-max CRB are obtained for the antenna movement region with arbitrary shapes. Moreover, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to obtain a locally optimal solution for MAs' positions by iteratively optimizing one between their horizontal and vertical coordinates with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed 1D/2D MA arrays can significantly decrease the CRB of AoA estimation MSE as well as the actual MSE compared to conventional uniform linear arrays (ULAs)/uniform planar arrays (UPAs) with different values of uniform inter-antenna spacing.","Thu, 2 May 2024 11:54:41 UTC (10,173 KB)"

To this end, we model an optimization problem as a mixed-integer problem with a cost function combining the number of gateways, flow allocation, and traffic latency, allowing satellite operators to set priorities based on their policies. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach effectively reduces the number of active gateways by selecting their most appropriate locations while balancing the trade-off between the number of gateways and traffic latency.

Additionally, it is essential to consider cross-cultural differences in the development of Automated Driving features tailored to different countries. Previous piloting studies have compared and analyzed cross-cultural differences in selected implicit driving cues, but they typically examine only limited countries. However, a comprehensive worldwide comparison and analysis are lacking. This study conducts a thorough review of existing literature, online blogs, and expert insights from diverse countries to investigate cross-cultural disparities in driving behaviors, specifically focusing on implicit cues such as non-verbal communication (e.g., hand gestures, signal lighting, honking), norms, and social expectations. Through comparative analysis, variations in driving cues are illuminated across different cultural contexts. Based on the findings and identified gaps, a research roadmap is proposed for future research to further explore and address these differences, aiming to enhance intercultural communication, improve road safety, and increase transportation efficiency on a global scale. This paper presents the pioneering work towards a comprehensive understanding of the implicit driving cues across cultures. Moreover, this understanding will inform the development of automated driving systems tailored to different countries considering cross-cultural differences.","Thu, 2 May 2024 09:30:08 UTC (222 KB)"
"127","Faster Learned Sparse Retrieval with Block-Max Pruning","Antonio Mallia, Torten Suel, Nicola Tonellotto","Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","Learned sparse retrieval systems aim to combine the effectiveness of contextualized language models with the scalability of conventional data structures such as inverted indexes. Nevertheless, the indexes generated by these systems exhibit significant deviations from the ones that use traditional retrieval models, leading to a discrepancy in the performance of existing query optimizations that were specifically developed for traditional structures. These disparities arise from structural variations in query and document statistics, including sub-word tokenization, leading to longer queries, smaller vocabularies, and different score distributions within posting lists. This paper introduces Block-Max Pruning (BMP), an innovative dynamic pruning strategy tailored for indexes arising in learned sparse retrieval environments. BMP employs a block filtering mechanism to divide the document space into small, consecutive document ranges, which are then aggregated and sorted on the fly, and fully processed only as necessary, guided by a defined safe early termination criterion or based on approximate retrieval requirements. Through rigorous experimentation, we show that BMP substantially outperforms existing dynamic pruning strategies, offering unparalleled efficiency in safe retrieval contexts and improved tradeoffs between precision and efficiency in approximate retrieval tasks.","Thu, 2 May 2024 09:26:30 UTC (73 KB)"

In recent years, the rapid development of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies have introduced a new platform for watching games. Visualization of sports competitions in VR/AR represents a revolutionary technology, providing audiences with a novel immersive viewing experience. However, there is still a lack of related research in this area. In this work, we present for the first time a comprehensive system for sports competition analysis and real-time visualization on VR/AR platforms. First, we utilize multiview LiDARs and cameras to collect multimodal game data. Subsequently, we propose a framework for multi-player tracking and pose estimation based on a limited amount of supervised data, which extracts precise player positions and movements from point clouds and images. Moreover, we perform avatar modeling of players to obtain their 3D models. Ultimately, using these 3D player data, we conduct competition analysis and real-time visualization on VR/AR. Extensive quantitative experiments demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our multi-player tracking and pose estimation framework. The visualization results showcase the immense potential of our sports visualization system on the domain of watching games on VR/AR devices.

Kunz-Schughart, Steffen Lange, Anja Voss-Böhme","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are advanced cell culture systems for assessing the impact of combinatorial radio(chemo)therapy. They exhibit therapeutically relevant in-vivo-like characteristics from 3D cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to radial pathophysiological gradients related to proliferative activity and nutrient/oxygen supply, altering cellular radioresponse. State-of-the-art assays quantify long-term curative endpoints based on collected brightfield image time series from large treated spheroid populations per irradiation dose and treatment arm. Here, spheroid control probabilities are documented analogous to in-vivo tumor control probabilities based on Kaplan-Meier curves. This analyses require laborious spheroid segmentation of up to 100.000 images per treatment arm to extract relevant structural information from the images, e.g., diameter, area, volume and circularity. While several image analysis algorithms are available for spheroid segmentation, they all focus on compact MCTS with clearly distinguishable outer rim throughout growth. However, treated MCTS may partly be detached and destroyed and are usually obscured by dead cell debris. We successfully train two Fully Convolutional Networks, UNet and HRNet, and optimize their hyperparameters to develop an automatic segmentation for both untreated and treated MCTS. We systematically validate the automatic segmentation on larger, independent data sets of spheroids derived from two human head-and-neck cancer cell lines. We find an excellent overlap between manual and automatic segmentation for most images, quantified by Jaccard indices at around 90%. For images with smaller overlap of the segmentations, we demonstrate that this error is comparable to the variations across segmentations from different biological experts, suggesting that these images represent biologically unclear or ambiguous cases.","Thu, 2 May 2024 09:14:38 UTC (13,014 KB)"

Even when the unknown stochastic disturbance exists, and the time-variant reference trajectory is required, the strict non-overshooting stabilization is still achieved. The control law design is based on a desired second-order sliding mode (2-sliding mode), which successively includes two bounded-gain subsystems. Non-overshooting stability requires that the system gains depend on the initial values of system variables. In order to obtain the global non-overshooting stability, the first subsystem with non-overshooting reachability compresses the initial values of the second subsystem to a given bounded range. By partitioning these initial values, the bounded system gains are determined to satisfy the robust non-overshooting stability. In order to reject the chattering in the controller output, a tanh-function-based sliding mode is developed for the design of smoothed non-overshooting controller. The proposed method is applied to a UAV trajectory tracking when the disturbances and uncertainties exist. The control laws are designed to implement the non-overshooting stabilization in position and attitude. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the flying tests.","Thu, 2 May 2024 08:33:41 UTC (4,352 KB)"

However, the existing prediction methods suffer from low prediction accuracy with the lack of spatial-temporal correlation features related to parking volume, and neglect of flow patterns and correlations between similar parking lots within certain areas. To address these challenges, this study proposes a parking availability prediction framework integrating spatial-temporal deep learning with multi-source data fusion, encompassing traffic demand data from multiple sources (e.g., metro, bus, taxi services), and parking lot data. The framework is based on the Transformer as the spatial-temporal deep learning model and leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones, extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) connected to parking lots. Real-world empirical data was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with different machine learning, deep learning, and traditional statistical models for predicting parking availability. Experimental results reveal that, with the proposed pipeline, the developed Transformer model outperforms other models in terms of various metrics, e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). By fusing multi-source demanding data with spatial-temporal deep learning techniques, this approach offers the potential to develop parking availability prediction systems that furnish more accurate and timely information to both drivers and urban planners, thereby fostering more efficient and sustainable urban mobility.","Thu, 2 May 2024 07:28:27 UTC (540 KB)"

The traditional server-based architecture of ASR also presents privacy concerns, alongside reliability and latency issues due to network dependencies. In contrast, on-device (edge) ASR enhances privacy, boosts performance, and promotes sustainability by effectively balancing energy use and accuracy for specific applications. This study examines the effects of quantization, memory demands, and energy consumption on the performance of various ASR model inference on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. By analyzing WER and transcription speed across models using FP32, FP16, and INT8 quantization on clean and noisy datasets, we highlight the crucial trade-offs between accuracy, speeds, quantization, energy efficiency, and memory needs. We found that changing precision from fp32 to fp16 halves the energy consumption for audio transcription across different models, with minimal performance degradation. A larger model size and number of parameters neither guarantees better resilience to noise, nor predicts the energy consumption for a given transcription load. These, along with several other findings offer novel insights for optimizing ASR systems within energy- and memory-limited environments, crucial for the development of efficient on-device ASR solutions.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that achieves robust performances while completely eliminating downlink CSIT training and feedback. Specifically, by exploiting partial frequency invariance of channel parameters between the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL), we adopt the 2D-Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-NOMP) algorithm to reconstruct DL CSIT from UL training. Due to inherent discrepancies arising from a carrier frequency difference between two disjoint bands, however, the multi-user interference is inevitable. To overcome this, we propose a precoding method that employs rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and also develop an error covariance matrix (ECM) estimation method by using the observed Fisher information matrix (O-FIM). We find that this ECM estimation is crucial for our precoding design in maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that our method significantly improves the sum SE compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, underscoring the importance of our ECM estimation.","Thu, 2 May 2024 03:33:09 UTC (486 KB)"

To this, end, several methods to reconstruct the density matrix, quantum state tomography protocols, have been developed and tested on photoelectrons ejected from noble gases following absorption of XUV photons from attosecond pulses. It remains a challenge to obtain model-free, single scan protocols that can reconstruct the density matrix with high fidelities. Current methods require extensive measurements or involve complex fitting of the signal. Faithful single-scan reconstructions would be of great help to increase the number of systems that can be studied. We propose a new and more efficient protocol - rainbow-KRAKEN - that is able to reconstruct the continuous variable density matrix of a photoelectron in a single time delay scan. It is based on measuring the coherences of a photoelectron created by absorption of an XUV pulse using a broadband IR probe that is scanned in time and a narrowband IR reference that is temporally fixed to the XUV pulse. We illustrate its performance for a Fano resonance in He as well as mixed states in Ar arising from spin-orbit splitting. We show that the protocol results in excellent fidelities and near-perfect estimation of the purity.","Thu, 2 May 2024 03:15:02 UTC (1,993 KB)"

Dimarogonas","Systems and Control (eess.SY)","This paper studies the controller synthesis problem for nonlinear control systems under linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications using zonotope techniques. A local-to-global control strategy is proposed for the desired specification expressed as an LTL formula. First, a novel approach is developed to divide the state space into finite zonotopes and constrained zonotopes, which are called cells and allowed to intersect with the neighbor cells. Second, from the intersection relation, a graph among all cells is generated to verify the realization of the accepting path for the LTL formula. The realization verification determines if there is a need for the control design, and also results in finite local LTL formulas. Third, once the accepting path is realized, a novel abstraction-based method is derived for the controller design. In particular, we only focus on the cells from the realization verification and approximate each cell thanks to properties of zonotopes. Based on local symbolic models and local LTL formulas, an iterative synthesis algorithm is proposed to design all local abstract controllers, whose existence and combination establish the global controller for the LTL formula. Finally, the proposed framework is illustrated via a path planning problem of mobile robots.","Thu, 2 May 2024 00:44:59 UTC (546 KB)"

Internal structure may introduce a new degree of freedom and qualitatively change the dynamics of interacting particles. For certain conditions, namely for the dilute plasma, description of single-particle dynamics in the focused structured laser beams is the first step and may serve as a good approximation on the way of understanding the global plasma response. Moreover, the general problem of integrability in complex systems starts from consideration of the integrals of motion for a single particle. The primary goal of this work is an understanding of the physics of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) absorption by a single particle in a focused structured light. A theoretical model of the process, including solutions of Maxwell equations with the required accuracy and a high-order perturbative approach to electron motion in external electromagnetic fields, is developed and its predictions are examined with numerical simulations for several exemplary electromagnetic field configurations. In particular, it was found that for the particles distributed initially with the azimuthal symmetry around the beam propagation direction, the transferred OAM has a smallness of the fourth order of the applied field amplitude, and requires an accurate consideration of the temporal laser pulse envelope.","Wed, 1 May 2024 23:33:52 UTC (1,358 KB)"

A fundamental result in the control theory of quantum systems states that the set of achievable evolutions is (dense in) the Lie group corresponding to the Lie algebra generated by the Hamiltonians of the system. Such a dynamical Lie algebra therefore characterizes all the state transitions available for a given system. For the Ising spin periodic chain we characterize such a dynamical Lie algebra and therefore the set of all reachable states. In particular, we prove that the dynamical Lie algebra is a (3n-1)-dimensional Lie sub-algebra of su(2^n) which is a direct sum of a two dimensional center and a (3n-3)-dimensional semisimple Lie subalgebra. This in turn is the direct sum of n-1 Lie algebras isomorphic to su(2) parametrized by the eigenvalues of a fixed matrix. We display the basis for each of these Lie subalgebras. Therefore the problem of control for the Ising spin periodic chain is, modulo the two dimensional center, a problem of simultaneous control of n-1 spin 1/2 particles. In the process of proving this result, we develop some tools which are of general interest for the controllability analysis of quantum systems with symmetry.","Wed, 1 May 2024 23:05:40 UTC (22 KB)"

In addition to a variety of build scheduling and test selection heuristics studied in the past, new artifact-based build technologies like Bazel have built-in support for advanced performance optimizations such as parallel build and incremental build (caching of build results). However, little is known about the extent to which new build technologies like Bazel deliver on their promised benefits, especially for long-build duration projects.
In this study, we collected 383 Bazel projects from GitHub, then studied their parallel and incremental build usage of Bazel in 4 popular CI services, and compared the results with Maven projects. We conducted 3,500 experiments on 383 Bazel projects and analyzed the build logs of a subset of 70 buildable projects to evaluate the performance impact of Bazel's parallel builds. Additionally, we performed 102,232 experiments on the 70 buildable projects' last 100 commits to evaluate Bazel's incremental build performance. Our results show that 31.23% of Bazel projects adopt a CI service but do not use Bazel in the CI service, while for those who do use Bazel in CI, 27.76% of them use other tools to facilitate Bazel's execution. Compared to sequential builds, the median speedups for long-build duration projects are 2.00x, 3.84x, 7.36x, and 12.80x, at parallelism degrees 2, 4, 8, and 16, respectively, even though, compared to a clean build, applying incremental build achieves a median speedup of 4.22x (with a build system tool-independent CI cache) and 4.71x (with a build system tool-specific cache) for long-build duration projects.

Nikolic","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","We develop a Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) for open quantum systems interacting with a dissipative environment and apply it to the spin-boson model as an archetypical example where the environment is composed of a bosonic bath. Prior SKFT developments of this type have been confined to the Markovian regime, as an alternative to a conventional description by the Lindblad quantum master equation (QME) which is a time-local matrix differential equation. Here we combine SKFT with a two-particle irreducible (2PI) action that resums a class of Feynman diagrams to infinite order. We obtain the time-evolution of the spin density matrix in the form of a system of integro-differential equations applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The latter regime--where taking into account memory effects becomes essential--poses a challenge for standard methods when trying to incorporate arbitrary properties of the system, bath, and length of time evolution. The SKFT+2PI-computed time evolution of the spin expectation values in the Markovian regime reproduces the solution of the Lindblad QME, as long as the system-bath coupling in the latter is adjusted by increasing it. In the non-Markovian regime, SKFT+2PI yields a nonperturbative solution that mimics results from both hierarchical equations of motion and tensor networks methods that we employ as benchmarks. Our SKFT+2PI approach can also access challenging cases, such as zero-temperature and sub-Ohmic bath, as well as arbitrary long evolution times. Taking into account favorable numerical cost of solving the integro-differential equations with increasing number of spins, time steps or dimensionality the SKFT+2PI approach offers a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and spintronics in the presence of a variety of (single or multiple) dissipative environments.","Wed, 1 May 2024 17:57:08 UTC (540 KB)"

However, current practices ignore some fundamental issues resulting from young children's developmental readiness, such as the sustained capability to keyboarding, the decomposition of complex tasks to small tasks, the need for intuitive mapping from abstract programming to tangible outcomes, and the limited amount of screen time exposure. To address these issues in this paper, we present a novel methodology with an AI-powered integration platform to effectively teach computational thinking for young children. The system features a hybrid pedagogy that supports both the top-down and bottom-up approach for teaching computational thinking. Young children can describe their desired task in natural language, while the system can respond with an easy-to-understand program consisting of the right level of decomposed sub-tasks. A tangible robot can immediately execute the decomposed program and demonstrate the program's outcomes to young children. The system is equipped with an intelligent chatbot that can interact with young children through natural languages, and children can speak to the chatbot to complete all the needed programming tasks, while the chatbot orchestrates the execution of the program onto the robot. This would completely eliminates the need of keyboards for young children to program. By developing such a system, we aim to make the concept of computational thinking more accessible to young children, fostering a natural understanding of programming concepts without the need of explicit programming skills. Through the interactive experience provided by the robotic agent, our system seeks to engage children in an effective manner, contributing to the field of educational technology for early childhood computer science education.","Wed, 1 May 2024 04:29:21 UTC (6,679 KB)"

In particular, these two modules are interconnected using a designated data structure called ""proposal"". Finally, we conduct extensive simulations over the newly developed dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our designs. Our code and dataset are now available as open-source (this https URL).","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:40:19 UTC (1,179 KB)"
"149","Evaluating the Application of ChatGPT in Outpatient Triage Guidance: A Comparative Study","Dou Liu, Ying Han, Xiandi Wang, Xiaomei Tan, Di Liu, Guangwu Qian, Kang Li, Dan Pu, Rong Yin","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare presents a transformative potential for enhancing operational efficiency and health outcomes. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have shown their capabilities in supporting medical decision-making. Embedding LLMs in medical systems is becoming a promising trend in healthcare development. The potential of ChatGPT to address the triage problem in emergency departments has been examined, while few studies have explored its application in outpatient departments. With a focus on streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency for outpatient triage, this study specifically aims to evaluate the consistency of responses provided by ChatGPT in outpatient guidance, including both within-version response analysis and between-version comparisons. For within-version, the results indicate that the internal response consistency for ChatGPT-4.0 is significantly higher than ChatGPT-3.5 (p=0.03) and both have a moderate consistency (71.2% for 4.0 and 59.6% for 3.5) in their top recommendation. However, the between-version consistency is relatively low (mean consistency score=1.43/3, median=1), indicating few recommendations match between the two versions. Also, only 50% top recommendations match perfectly in the comparisons. Interestingly, ChatGPT-3.5 responses are more likely to be complete than those from ChatGPT-4.0 (p=0.02), suggesting possible differences in information processing and response generation between the two versions. The findings offer insights into AI-assisted outpatient operations, while also facilitating the exploration of potentials and limitations of LLMs in healthcare utilization. Future research may focus on carefully optimizing LLMs and AI integration in healthcare systems based on ergonomic and human factors principles, precisely aligning with the specific needs of effective outpatient triage.","Sat, 27 Apr 2024 04:12:02 UTC (432 KB)"

Many researchers are working to develop new models to decode EEG signals into text form. Although this area has shown promising developments, it still faces numerous challenges that necessitate further improvement. It's important to outline this area's recent developments and future research directions. In this review article, we thoroughly summarize the progress in EEG-to-text conversion. Firstly, we talk about how EEG-to-text technology has grown and what problems we still face. Secondly, we discuss existing techniques used in this field. This includes methods for collecting EEG data, the steps to process these signals, and the development of systems capable of translating these signals into coherent text. We conclude with potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for enhanced accuracy, reduced system constraints, and the exploration of novel applications across varied sectors. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to contribute to developing more accessible and effective Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology for a broader user base.","Fri, 26 Apr 2024 21:18:05 UTC (1,305 KB)"
