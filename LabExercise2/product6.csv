"1","Sling Bag",NA,"Amazon Customer","Love it, initially I was doubting that the extra money was justified, when I received it I was concerned that it wouldn't fit my neck.  As soon as I tried it I was convinced this was the capo for me.  Small in size, nearly half the size of my other capo's which means it doesn't restrict as much up the neck.  Easy to use, simple clamp on.  Works a treat.  Claims to come with a lifetime warranty, hopefully I won't have to test this.  Fits my electrics and acoustics.

"4","Sling Bag",NA,"Remy","The new 'ART' design is nice as it helps put even pressure and conforms with the shape of the fingerboard.However, I found the release mechanism confusing. I still own one of the original G7th and found out that the release on the ART version works the opposite. I could only wish that the release method was not changed.

"6","Sling Bag",NA,"B Lapena","Sleek design, light and solid. Precise engineering and materials. You can 'feel' it's dependability. In fifty years of 'stringing along' i've seen, wrecked and hated a lot of capos. This thing is the best i've ever used or seen, can't imagine how it could be wrecked and i like it a lot. Even the designers (UK) anti-latter-day-slavery promulgation are admirable. Too bad it couldn't be made in the UK.

"7","Sling Bag",NA,"Andrew Yong","This capo is light, compact, easy to use and is gentle on the guitar neck. It is very effective on curved and straight necks (electric and acoustic). Not only that... the mechanism is pretty neat - a talking point at rehearsals :-).

"8","Sling Bag",NA,"Gerry Taylor","It's not a bad capo.  But considering I was paying for a premium capo, it should be a significant improvement over the cheap one I had been using.  But rather than it being a case of being able to put it on with just enough pressure to work and not so much it puts the guitar slightly out of tune, I find I've got to be really careful how I put it on to make sure I don't have a string or two buzzing and pretty much am squeezing it really hard to make help avoid that buzzing, so not sure how well that will do in improving tuning.So it's possible the old capo would cause very minor tuning issues, but I'd clip it on and play and not have any real issues.  While this one I find I always need to have a quick strum after putting it on to make sure I have it on properly with no buzzing strings, and then sometimes need some adjustment to fix those buzzing strings.Not the super awesome capo I thought it was going to be!

"9","Sling Bag",NA,"Amazon Customer","Title really says it all. This is a sleek, low profle tool that quietly and effectively gets the job done. I am really pleased with it. I will probably buy another to keep in the case 'cause I can see this growing legs if left unattended.
