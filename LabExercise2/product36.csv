"6","Electronics","Kodak PIXPRO AZ528 Astro Zoom 16MP Digital Camera, Black","Thenault S.","Vorweg: Die Kamera war ein Geschenk f√ºr unsere Tochter, die endlich mehr will, als das Handy als Fotoapparat zu missbrauchen.Es gibt in dieser Preisklasse keine guten Alternativen, und wenn, dann sind es oft Mogelpackungen. Ein Beispiel: Diese Kamera hat ein echtes optisches Zoom, bei der Konkurrenz wird da oft nur ganz klein erw√§hnt, dass sie nur ein digitales (wertloses) Zoom haben. Angeregt von den anderen Bewertungen kauften wir bei Amazon auch ein perfektes Stativ dazu (https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0CL9NFG94/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), und seitdem gelingen Fotos beispielsweise nachts vom Mond so, wie man es auf vielen Youtubes zu dieser Kamera bestaunen kann. Die Tiefensch√§rfe ist beachtlich, lediglich beim Autofocus muss man bei einer derart hohen Zoomeinstellung ein bisschen warten. Wir haben vor dem Kauf viele Stunden lang recherchiert, verglichen und zahlreiche Videos und Bilder, Ergebnisse dieses Kameratyps gesucht. Ich kann nun sagen, dass √ºberwiegend auch bei uns diese unglaublich qualitativen, tollen und scharfen Bilder rauskommen, ohne viel tricksen zu m√ºssen. Einfach so, gucken, klicken, betrachten.W-Lan Funktion:Das ist eine tolle M√∂glichkeit, √ºber den Umweg eines Smartphones Videos sofort ins Internet zu stellen. Das war unserer 12-j√§hrigen Tochter mit ihrem eigenen Youtube-Kanal besonders wichtig und diese M√∂glichkeit gibt es um diesen Preis sonst nirgendwo. Die Funktion samt stabiler Verbindung zwischen Kamera und Handy ist f√ºr mein Alter (63) doch etwas tricky zu installieren gewesen, doch dann habe ich es doch noch geschafft, eine dauerhaft stabile Smartphone-Verbindung herstellen k√∂nnen. Laura meint, sie funktioniert seither immer tadellos.Wir haben auch noch nachtr√§glich das Set mit 2 Akkus und einem Ladeger√§t gekauft (siehe auch Amazon, z.B. https://www.amazon.de/s?k=kodak+528+akku), denn der eine beigelegte Akku ist doch etwas wenig, beispielsweise ausw√§rts im Urlaub wird es da bald knapp. Diese zus√§tzlichen Lade-Sets sind unglaublich g√ºnstig (2 Akkus, 1 Ladeger√§t je nach Kapazit√§t etwa 20-33 Euro) und effektiv. Wir wollen n√§mlich nicht jedes Mal das Ladekabel an die Kamera anstecken und die Angst, dadurch irgendwann versehentlich die Ladebuchse an der Kamera zu zerst√∂ren, war es uns Wert, hier noch g√ºnstig nachzukaufen. Die Akkus gehen sehr einfach rein, die Klappe geht auf Klick auf und ist f√ºr ein ganzes Kamera-Leben lang sehr solide und haltbar konstruiert. Das ist viel einfacher, wie den Deckel zur versteckten Ladebuchse aufbiegen zu m√ºssen, wo auch das Kabel wegen der Kameraumgebung nur wenig Platz findet.Unsere Tochter hat sich dann gleich noch die passendste und sch√∂nste Tasche ausgesucht, frei nach dem Motto ""das zahlt ja eh der Papa"" - siehe Amazon https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0BPLDGRPM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1, die ist unglaublich sch√∂n und neben der Kamera finden darin eine weitere Speicherkarte und die Ladeger√§t-/Akkukombination Platz darin. Achja, es funktionieren entgegen der Angaben von Kodak auch Speicherkarten, die gr√∂sser als 32Gb sind, ohne da irgendetwas eigens und auf einem PC neu formatieren zu m√ºssen. Wir haben auf Amazon diese Karte bestellt, eingelegt, und die Kamera hat sie sofort erkannt:https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B09X7C7NCZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Aussehen (bei uns das schwarze Modell):Professionell, insgesamt wurden hochwertige Materialien verarbeitet, die nicht billig, sondern edel aussehen. Die dauerhafte Haltbarkeit sieht man f√∂rmlich.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 25 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"14","Electronics","Kodak PIXPRO AZ528 Astro Zoom 16MP Digital Camera, Black","fabiola c.","Ordered this for my wife to take pictures of birds in our yard using a lens hood and UV filter (both must be purchased separately).  It has not been used indoors.  The major problem with this camera is the lack of a viewfinder.  Pictures must be set up using the small LCD screen on the back of the camera.  Unfortunately, when you use the camera outside, the screen shows your own reflection looking back at you and you can't see what you are aiming at. I contacted Kodak customer service to see if anything could be done about this: perhaps a non-reflective coating that could be applied to the screen.  This was their reply:  ""...when hit with sunlight the screen will look black and the only thing you can do is hover your hand over the top of the camera to keep the sun from hitting the LCD screen before pressing the shutter button.""  Unless you have 3 hands or are using a tripod this is an unworkable solution.  The shutter and zoom controls are on the right side of the camera so you hold the camera on the right.  You need to steady the camera with your left hand when the zoom is extended because the camera becomes front heavy.  Using this camera is like standing in a crowd and holding your cell phone over your head to try to take a picture of something you can't really see.  Sometimes you get a good picture, most times you don't.  It's not point and shoot - it's guess and hope.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 22 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"40","Electronics","Kodak PIXPRO AZ528 Astro Zoom 16MP Digital Camera, Black","David Dorrell","Review of KODAK PIXPRO Astro Zoom AZ528-BK 16 MP Digital Camera with 52x Optical Zoom 24mm Wide Angle Lens 6 fps Burst Shooting 1080P Full HD Video Wi-Fi Connectivity and a 3"" LCD Screen (Black)When I was young, my first film camera was a Kodak.  I‚Äôm glad to see they have made the transition to digital photography.This is a bridge camera.  Meaning it has some features of a Point and Shoot camera and some features of a Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera It has a non-changeable lens like a point-and-shoot or a cell phone camera, but it has a moveable lens that gives awesome optical magnification similar to a DSLR with changeable lenses.The Kodak AZ528 allows for various manual settings that are not available in many point and shoot cameras, but it can function well as a point-and-shoot in its automated setting.  You can set it to automate Aperture settings (A) while you manually adjust the ISO, and shutter speed, or vice-versa the other settings.  You can go full manual (M) on aperture, shutter, ISO.  The one thing I wish it could do (maybe I just don‚Äôt know how to do it) is to allow fully manual focus.  Focusing seems to be an automated process that you can select between three options.  The most trouble I have with the camera is having it focus correctly.  I can‚Äôt always get images to focus.  For instance if I attempt to focus on a printed image on a package, it won‚Äôt resolve the edges of the graphic on the package, blurring the entire image.  If I zoom out away from the graphic on the package and focus on the edges of the package it resolves much sharper.  As I said, I may just not have figured out how it works yet.When I get the focus right, it does great and the image is sharp and clear when automated, or suitably adjusted to the manual settings employed, like blurred per creative use of shutter speed.It‚Äôs a lot of camera for the money ($211 today) with many of the features that my DSLR camera that costs three times as much has.  It also has an optical zoom that my DSLR can‚Äôt match with my longest lens!I can see this camera becoming my vacation camera, as it can do point and shoot and some artistic manual shots and because of its incredible optical zoom capability (you can digitally zoom out to 200x)I‚Äôve attached a few shots from the Kodak.  One shot of the red package I was playing a bit with the manual settings, the other two are a test of the optical zoom.  I‚Äôve cropped the distant shot a bit and added a circle to show the area being zoomed, but you‚Äôll get the idea, the other is zoomed to the full optical zoom level (52x).Very nice camera.  Giving it 4 stars only because of my difficulty in getting the camera to focus occasionally.  I may modify that if I find the fault is that I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing.",NA,"Reviewed in the United States on 25 December 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"41","Electronics","Kodak PIXPRO AZ528 Astro Zoom 16MP Digital Camera, Black","John TK","Nice little camera that operates largely through preset modes. Higher end photographers will probably want more flexibility, but for the less experienced user it's a nice step up and a more traditional feel than you get from your smartphone.

"42","Electronics","Kodak PIXPRO AZ528 Astro Zoom 16MP Digital Camera, Black","Andrew W. Johns","I enjoy photography, although I'll readily admit to being an amateur. My normal camera is a a mirrorless Lumix G-9, and while that isn't a particularly big or heavy camera, sometimes it is nice to have something even smaller and lighter. This camera is very compact and easy to carry. It takes great photos and videos, with an easy to use zoom, and a variety of useful photo modes and built in digital filters. Over all, I like the way this camera works, but there are a couple of quirks that I really dislike. The first is the lack of a view finder. While the display works well for framing shots under most circumstances, but when I'm outside on a bright, sunny day, the display is very difficult to see, which leaves me guessing about the framing of my shots. So, having a view finder would be helpful, or perhaps a display that was easier to see in bright light. The other issue I have is the placement of the video record button at the top right corner on the back of the camera. Because of the way I hold the camera, I find that I often end up accidently pressing the button with my thumb, recording video while I'm trying to frame and shoot photos. Because it isn't always easy to tell that it is recording, I find myself struggling with the camera, frustrated that I can capture the shots I want.",NA,"Reviewed in the United States on 17 May 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"43","Electronics","Kodak PIXPRO AZ528 Astro Zoom 16MP Digital Camera, Black","Tim A.","This camera looks and feels like good quality, but unfortunately the image quality is fairly disappointing. For 'standard' photos where you're within 20 feet or so of whatever you're taking a photo of, any modern smartphone will take a clearer photo (see comparison attached between this camera and my iPhone, taken from about 10 feet away in normal daylight conditions). The KODAK PixPro's photo looks okay from an initial look, but if you were to print the photo at a large scale or zoom in at all, the photo very quickly becomes blurry.The 'auto' mode is fairly standard, you half-press the shutter button and it attempts to autofocus on the target, then full-press the button to take the photo. In playing with some of the other manual settings, I was not able to significantly improve the image quality over the 'auto' mode so I have continued to use the 'auto' mode since it is definitely most convenient. With my photo size and quality set to the highest levels, the photos are 3456 pixels by 4608 pixels (or 16 megapixels) but as mentioned before, the definition does not match that of an iPhone camera from short range.One thing that I found odd was that the camera did not include an SD card nor did it include full user manual (only a 'quick start guide' with a QR code to the user manual). The online user manual recommends purchasing a ""class 4 SD card from a name brand with 4GB to 32GB capacity,"" it also states that the camera is ""not compatible with Micro SD, Ultra, Ultra Plus, Extreme, or adapters for any of these other memory cards.""The limited SD card size is super odd - a camera that should be taking high quality photos (i.e. large files) only supporting small (less than 32GB SD cards) seems like a design flaw. Worry not though, I tested my camera with a three different SD cards: an 'approved' Sandisk 32 GB SD card, an 'unsupported' 64 GB 'Extreme' SD card, and an 'unsupported' 128 GB 'Ultra' SD card. All three flash cards worked just fine with no noticeable issues or image quality problems with the larger SD cards.This camera doesn't entirely fall flat of a smart phone camera, however. This thing has incredible optical zoom that would be great for sports, birding, and other hobbies. It also has some other 'fun' modes that work well (long exposure for firework photos, sport mode for fast-moving objects, etc).All in all, the image quality isn't the best but it does have some unique components that work well. If you're looking for a general-use camera, I would look elsewhere. If you're looking to take distant photos that require a lot of zoom without spending a lot more money on a camera, this may fit your needs.",NA,"Reviewed in the United States on 28 December 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Took several great photos but quite a few duds mixed in.  I found that it is a little harder to get a sharp focus than my other brand of camera and works best when sitting stable or on a tripod, especially when it is zoomed in.  It is large and bulky but on the lighter side.  Definitely not the best option for some place where you would be on the move shooting or bouncing around.  I also had a little bit of an issue getting the flash to work when I needed it to.  I was shooting in lower light by the Christmas tree and wanted a few shots where they were front lit more than what room lighting allowed.  I popped the flash out and the camera decided that it didn't need to be on so it didn't use the flash.  I have another more compact camera that shoots with flash if the flash bulb is deployed.  It has a lot of options and customization settings available and has the workings of an advanced camera but is not my favorite just because of the blur factor and the lack of ease in focusing.",NA,"Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"46","Electronics","Kodak PIXPRO AZ528 Astro Zoom 16MP Digital Camera, Black","Russtiffer","I've owned some much more expensive cameras, and was not expecting this. First of all, the build quality is better than cameras that cost 2 or 3 times as much. Love the more matte finish, rather than the shiny slick one that most cameras have. Gives you a more confident grip. And I imagine that can be super beneficial when your hands are wet or sweaty, in the heat.The picture quality on the monitor screen is magnificent, ESPECIALLY with the variable ND filter I put on it. Another thing I love about this camera. It has a 52mm thread for goodies, rather than some oddball thread that's hard to find things for. I already have a few ND and UV filters for it, and am so excited to finally be able to get that ""cinematic"" look for my videos.The only ""flaws"" I see, aren't enough to deduct any stars, because of how much it excells in some areas, and the price it's doing said excelling at. These are more like improvememts I'd like to see. Needs a flip screen, so that you don't need an external monitor to see yourself, if you're vlogging. It also needs at least one, and preferably two shoe mounts on top or side. And lastly, I'd like to see some kind of carry case. At least a neoprene cover so you can throw it in a backpack or something until you get a case. Or, it could come with one. I'm sure these improvements would raise the price, but it'd be at least twice as cool if it had them.The operation of this it more user-friendly than another camera I had, that was supposed to be the most user-friendly mirrorless camera on the market, and it wasn't. This is a badass beginner's camera, for those wanting to get into DSLRs eventually, at a fraction of the price, and a comparable build quality, even almost comparable in performance.I Totally Dig It üëç",NA,"Reviewed in the United States on 14 December 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Easy to charge, insert and remove battery and sd card***Cons, Dislikes*Only uses a 32gb SD card max*auto focus and auto flash don't work correctly. I had them on and the pictures would either come out too dark or they would come out good but the colors wouldn't look good. like Christmas pictures today the tree would be brown - it was a fake tree and the tree was green.*Not easy to use or figure out best settings for things - Being in auto mode does NOT help the situation*Would NOT recommend for a indoor camera*I have had cheaper cameras that did a way better job of taking photos than this, and that was 20 years ago - worse resolution only but the photos were bright and vivid just grainy. This the photos are dark, color challenged, and the resolution is much better. I would rather a grainy photo than a good resolution that the photo looks like crap anyways. Could not use this for Christmas - VERY DISAPPOINTED*Did not come with a storage case for the camera, also screen does not pull out or turn or anything. This is more like a higher resolution camera from the early 2000's - Just the pictures aren't worth keeping.*every time I take a picture there is a red light that distracts and then the picture takes and the outcome isn't as expected as when I pressed the shutter button.*Still looking for a good inexpensive easy to use camera - this is not it, and for a Kodak that really disappoints!",NA,"Reviewed in the United States on 26 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It‚Äôs definitely grainy and the focus is lackluster.

You can take this on the go and to the mountains especially because you can take your pics and not worry since they will be in the sim card. I love using real cameras instead of phone cameras!

This bridge camera is an update to the version I had about a decade ago, which I absolutely loved. Kodak has been very good to me and I've owned several of their cameras over the years. I took this one with me on a trip to Disney World last month. It worked as well as I recalled - lots of nice automatic features and settings that allow you to experiment to get the right look. It does beautifully at night, as well. What I found, though, is a large camera is no longer really the best option for sightseeing and vacationing. It was a bit of a burden to carry around and I left it in the hotel room after the first day. I just found my phone offers really great photos without the bulk of carrying a large camera. With that said, though, I will absolutely use the camera around the house, etc. This is a great camera if you're someone who doesn't mind the extra bulk of carrying a full camera and equipment.",NA,"Reviewed in the United States on 9 January 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"
