"4","Perfume","Katy Perry Killer Queen Eau De Parfum 100Ml","Sara","I'm not really into celebrity fragrances, but I heard good things about Killer Queen and the packaging intrigued me.Granted, said packaging is a disaster if you want to display your perfumes instead of in their box - which is large in this case - but it does look pretty. (I've put it next to my equally 'useless' Chopard-Wish lol).The scent itself reminds me of current ones that are rather popular by young and older women, namely Flowerbomb and in a lesser form La Vie Est Belle (which is way more powdery). However, the link to those two is most prominent when it's not cold.  The lower the temperature the more Killer Queen becomes its own fragrance.And that's a fragrance that'll surely be a hit with a younger crowd, though I myself like it too and with 45 years under my belt ""younger crowd""  definitely doesn't describe me.Killer Queen is what is often called - a bit demeaning  - a fruitchouli or (my preference) a fruity-floral. The opening in particular is a red fruit bomb with a rather strong forestfruit& prune accent. That combo gets help from a floral middle (carnation, frangipani, jasmine) of which the frangipani makes the most of it on my skin, with a touch of jasmine next to it. By then the fragrance is rather sweet, comparable to winegums or those chewy little haribo bears. This is where Killer Queen loses me for a while,  I'm not a fan of this particular sweetness.However, the dry down is the saviour because the praline, woody accords and patchouli give Killer Queen the necessary creamy, wood base it needs to lose some of that teeth clenching sugar. The fragrance balances out into a red fruity woody dry down with hints of flowers petals. If A Thousand Wishes BBW + Winterberry Wonder BBW had a baby and dipped it in pralined Patchouli Killer Queen might very well be it.Killer Queen does pretty well, considering my skin is not just extremely dry but also super acidic, meaning that even the best perfumes rarely last long and most can't even be noticed on me unless I go ham (example: I needed 30 sprays of an expensive designer fragrance before someone standing close realised I was wearing anything).I spray an equal amount,  I don't need more of it than I use of a quality designer edp and especially in the 1st hour it has quite the presence. It lasts a total about 3hrs, with half being skin scent on me. That's actually quite normal for most edps on me.Because my skin is so difficult it's hard to say what that means for regular skin, but I think that with 1 respray you'll last the day.  And you just need to spray the pulse points.For these prices that's bizarre. I got a big bottle for like 16 bucks or so and that's a major steal. If you're on a tight budget and in need of a decent quality fruity floral I absolutely recommend this fragrance. I still think it's better suited to a younger crowd because of the sweetness (depending on skintype this might actually keep in the dry down!), but if you're like me and sweetness rarely remains on your skin you could give it a go if you're into these type of scents.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Spain on 11 October 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"9","Perfume","Katy Perry Killer Queen Eau De Parfum 100Ml","Karine","Another good one from Katy Perry. In my opinion it isn't as good as Meow with its fresh vanilla, gardenia and pear notes, but still wonderful in its own right as a rich, warm and sultry scent on a budget. It is a great evening/winter fragrance with its cozy base notes of patchouli and prailine offset by the fruity top notes of wild berries and bergamot with floral middle notes for balance. It has a very sophisticated air to it. Killer Queen has a very familiar signature that I can't quite place my finger on. Since Meow is very reminiscent of the 80's perfume Electric Youth, I suspect Killer Queen borrows from another 80's fav that I have yet to remember. I would give it another star, but sadly, like Meow, it just doesn't have any staying power. But what do you expect for a 3.4 oz perfume under $20? All in all, a great perfume on a budget!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 18 August 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"39","Perfume","Katy Perry Killer Queen Eau De Parfum 100Ml","Sara","Love it.I'm just kinda 'meh' regarding Katy Perry's persona, so I definitely didn't buy this to support her. I like gourmand scents. This is one.So if you like Flowerbomb, Angel, Fancy, Fantasy, that sort of thing...this is up your alley.It is not nonstop sweet though. Like Angel, it's kinda that sweet-over-musk thing, but less 'sweaty' than Angel. You must have a certain skin chemistry to pull off Angel or she will turn on you. You will probably not have that problem with Killer Queen.Everyone I have asked enjoys this. I realize that those who hate a scent typically won't stop a stranger to let them know, but I have had many people ask what it is and follow with some manner of compliment. My man likes it, which is a plus.Heck, my mom asked what it was. She gets migraines at the drop of a pin and never uses scents. But she said it was very attractive and has borrowed my bottle to test drive it.It is super inexpensive here, you hardly can go wrong. No, it doesn't come with a stand. It just lays on its side. It's fine, people.I am an oaf and I have never rolled it off my dresser. It actually works for the vibe. Like you were a louche aristocrat, a Marie Antoinette who casually tossed a priceless jewel down on her dressing table as she went forth to tread on her enemies and receive tribute whilst calmly finishing her cake, perhaps pausing a moment to brush the crumbs of the men who crossed her this morning away before seeing to the next.I would absolutely buy this again.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Spain on 11 October 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
