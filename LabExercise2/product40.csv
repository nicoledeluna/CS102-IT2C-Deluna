"4","Electronics","Twelve South AirFly Pro Bluetooth Wireless Audio Transmitter/Receiver for up to 2 AirPods/Wireless Headphones; Use with Any 3.5 mm Audio Jack, Black","Martin Jackson","As a frequent traveler, the quest for the perfect travel accessory can feel endless, particularly when it comes to finding solutions that bridge the gap between modern wireless technology and the often outdated in-flight entertainment systems. The Twelve South AirFly Pro Bluetooth Wireless Audio Transmitter/Receiver emerges as a game-changer in this space, offering an elegant solution for using AirPods Pro 2 and other Bluetooth headphones with any 3.5mm audio jack. After using the AirFly Pro on multiple flights, I am thoroughly impressed by its performance, design, and the freedom it offers.Ease of UseThe AirFly Pro is remarkably user-friendly, with a simple setup process that involves plugging the device into the headphone jack of an in-flight entertainment system and pairing it with your AirPods Pro 2. The pairing process is swift and intuitive, allowing you to connect up to two devices simultaneously. This feature proved invaluable on a long-haul flight where both my partner and I could enjoy the same movie without the hassle of tangled wires or subpar airline headphones.Design and Build QualityCompact and lightweight, the AirFly Pro is the epitome of travel-friendly design. Its sleek black exterior is unobtrusive and blends well with any tech setup. Despite its small size, the device feels durable and well-made, capable of withstanding the rigors of travel without issue. The inclusion of a small travel pouch is a thoughtful touch, providing a convenient way to store and protect the device when not in use.PerformanceThe true test of any Bluetooth transmitter is its performance, particularly when it comes to maintaining a stable connection and delivering high-quality audio. The AirFly Pro excels in both areas. Throughout my flights, the connection to my AirPods Pro 2 remained flawless, with no noticeable lag or dropout. The audio quality transmitted was clear and crisp, allowing me to become fully immersed in movies and music, thus greatly enhancing my in-flight entertainment experience.Battery LifeWith a battery life of up to 16 hours, the AirFly Pro easily lasted through long flights, and it can be charged via USB-C, which is convenient and fast. The ability to charge it using the same cable as my laptop and phone simplifies packing and ensures the device is always ready for use.CompatibilityOne of the most appealing aspects of the AirFly Pro is its wide compatibility. It works not only with AirPods Pro 2 but with any Bluetooth-enabled headphones or earbuds. This versatility makes it an essential accessory not just for travel but for use at home with equipment lacking Bluetooth capability.ConclusionThe Twelve South AirFly Pro is an indispensable accessory for anyone looking to use wireless headphones with in-flight entertainment systems or any device with a 3.5mm audio jack. Its ease of use, excellent performance, and broad compatibility make it a standout product. The freedom to use my Apple AirPods Pro 2 during flights, without sacrificing audio quality or dealing with cumbersome wires, has significantly improved my travel experience. The AirFly Pro is a high-quality, versatile device that I would highly recommend to any traveler or audio enthusiast looking to bridge the gap between wireless audio and wired sources.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 17 March 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"7","Electronics","Twelve South AirFly Pro Bluetooth Wireless Audio Transmitter/Receiver for up to 2 AirPods/Wireless Headphones; Use with Any 3.5 mm Audio Jack, Black","DanielO","We bought the Pro version as this allows your phone to play music via the 3.5mm jack rather than the other way that the cheaper versions only offer.  Yes, I know there are far cheaper ways to achieve this, but I'm a sucker for great tech, and this little device hits all the spots for me.  It's USB-C - check, it's got awesome battery life - check, and it works solidly every time - check.  It's a cracking little unit, I have no negatives to speak of so I just hope this lasts for many years and I can't wait to test it out on a flight sometime soon!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"22","Electronics","Twelve South AirFly Pro Bluetooth Wireless Audio Transmitter/Receiver for up to 2 AirPods/Wireless Headphones; Use with Any 3.5 mm Audio Jack, Black","Buy Once, Cry Once","This is my unbiased review of the Twelve south Airfly Pro (black). The color you choose is somewhat important, more on that below.== SUMMARY ==Solid performance, very good audio quality paired with my 1st gen Apple Airpod Pros. Pleased with this product and would buy again.That said, there are a couple of flaws. If I could buy again, I may opt for the white color model.== PROS ==Universal compatibility on any airplane or laptop with standard 3.5mm headphone out jack.Long enough battery to watch four feature length movies on a cross-Pacific international flight using a single charge.Ability to charge via USB while paired with earbuds/Bluetooth headphones. (However, read the cons section.)Solid audio quality when paired with Apple Airpod Pro 1st Gen. I don't have any experience with the latest gen. Noise cancellation on my airpods were sufficient for me to enjoy my international flight. I don't plan to ever use wired headsets on a plane again.Very lightweight and includes a travel pouch.Uses USB-C as input for charging (very short charging cable included).== CONS ==One-time Bluetooth pairing setup took a few attempts to sync properly with my Airpod Pros. I would recommend pairing at home before you travel, rather than on the plane if you can avoid it. It will save you some hassle.USB charging is convenient while being able to listen, but there is a noticeable signal noise that was audible while listening so I had to unplug the USB cable while using. I would recommend fully charging the Airfly Pro before your travel. The signal interference was coming from the USB side. I tried switching to a non-OEM cable and still had the same issue with signal noise.As for the BLACK color, I have to criticize the poor usability choice of using black type font for labeling the TX and RX modes to switch between transmitting and receiving. As others have also stated, it is very difficult to read the label for the toggle switch. Sure, you could just memorize the position of your desired toggle, but any good product should have clearly visible labels. Just use white color font on a black device.Otherwise, white and black models are identical in features and I suspect performance.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 31 March 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I have it plugged in to the TV so I can use Bluetooth headphones for both gaming and movies. Its been working great.Since the aux plug on most TVs is on the back I do suggest an extension Aux cable or youll be reaching around to pair or power it on regularly.(That not fault of this device though.)Pairing took a moment to get a hang of, but instructions are included. (Amazing right!?!) And I believe most of the pairing issue I had was related to my headphones which had previously been paired to other devices.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 26 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

One fatal flaw - I got it to be able to connect to a laptop with AirPods to be able to listen and speak during conference calls at the same time. This can only do one at a time. I wish that was made clear. I love the AirFly, but I would have just gotten the normal (non-pro) had I know.Side note review on Twelve South: Amazing customer service!

"25","Electronics","Twelve South AirFly Pro Bluetooth Wireless Audio Transmitter/Receiver for up to 2 AirPods/Wireless Headphones; Use with Any 3.5 mm Audio Jack, Black","Kawika","I bought this to use on airplanes in conjunction with my Sony noise-cancelling headphones. The Airfly Pro works fairly well - sound quality is decent, and the battery lasts long enough to survive multi-leg transatlantic and transpacific trips. There is a slight audio delay, but not enough to bother me while watching movies. The Airfly is small and, as a nice bonus, fits nicely into my Sony's headphone case. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I think it's slightly overpriced for what is, essentially, a fairly cheap feeling/plasticky bluetooth transmitter. For the price I would've expected something a bit more premium feeling.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Sometimes I have to monitor what’s actually going on the air, and for that, I have to use an actual radio. It was a pain to have earbuds with wires dangling, especially when they would get caught on my microphone, and on my professional wired headphones. This Airfly device allows me to plug it into the radio, and connect my JBL earbuds, making my radio monitoring completely wireless. I love it. I’m sure it’s also perfect for its intended use (listening to in-flight movies on airplane seat backs), but I don’t do a ton of flying!  lol.

He showed me the way and was using it with Apple AirPods Max. I knew it was a good product and after reading reviews I purchased my own. Boy, has it come in handy. The obvious use is on airplane seat back entertainment systems. But, ANYTHING with a headphone jack is a candidate. I work freelance live audio/video events for a living and I have now used it with a digital mixer headphone system, a live video streaming audio confidence system and to broadcast audio from my hotel TV to my earbuds. Yes, there is some latency and I would guess it is around 60ms (not measured, just an educated guess). I can even use this with an adapter in RX mode as my audio interface to a large PA. It sounds that good - nearly indistinguishable from a hard 1/8” jack into a DI > XLR to mixer inputs. I am always looking for ways to lighten the load while traveling and to make my Pelican/backpack smaller and lighter.Get one.

"38","Electronics","Twelve South AirFly Pro Bluetooth Wireless Audio Transmitter/Receiver for up to 2 AirPods/Wireless Headphones; Use with Any 3.5 mm Audio Jack, Black","CHawk","I purchased the Airfly Pro after GREAT recommendations from fluent airplane travelers.  I ordered from Amazon as they offered the device in black.  Delivery was quick and I have since used it on two flights.  I have NOT been asked to provide this feedback.  Nor offered any gifts.  Here are my thoughts:1). The unit came with a small velvet-like drawstring carrying/storage bag that contained the device, instructions and a charging USB cable.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️2). The Airfly Pro unit contained a removable cap that protects the port itself from damage or anything that comes in contact with the port.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️3). The Airfly Pro was extremely easy to pair, even for an anti-techy like me!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️4).  The USB cable was the perfect length to plug into the unit and into the USB charging port on the airplanes monitor which kept the unit powered without requiring additional charging.  The first time I used the device, I used a longer USB cord that was way too long. Connecting the USB cable is OPTIONAL as a full charge seems to last at least 3-4 hours in constant use. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️5).  The wireless Bluetooth connectivity along with wireless headphones allowed easy movement, without the hassle of headphone cords!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️6). No static interference with movement of the Airfly Pro device and the sound transmission quality is superb.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Overall, the Airfly Pro is one of the best Bluetooth connectivity devices I ever uses.  I give it 5 out of 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 6 September 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Unfortunately their app kept cutting out at random times, and so with it the audio. It was so annoying! Now that I have this connected directly to my TV I can just turn on my headphones and watch without problems. The only thing ""wrong"" is I've noticed that it sets my headphones automatically at the highest volume every time I turn them on, so I have to turn them down every time.

I was on a Delra flight,  tv volume on max,  buds volume was on Max and even before take off it was hard to hear. Once the engines started at take off it was like hearing a whisper.  The SE model of this gadget has a volume control button so I may try that one.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
