"11","Phone Case","ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear","Mary Bate","This case is AMAZING. I've had it since November 2022. ESR did an Instagram giveaway of the (then new) iPhone 14 Pro, and I happened to win it! I decided to order their phone case for the iPhone 14 Pro phone, completely on my own accord. I was never prompted to buy their products at any time, but I decided to give them a try since their company was the reason I had a new phone (I had a 2021 Motorola Moto G Power before then, and the camera sucked.üíÄ As a media com student, I was very grateful to have won the giveaway since I was able to have a summer internship running a camp's social media page with an excellent camera... Definitely a gift from God).I am pleased to say that this case has held up INCREDIBLY well. It hasn't yellowed, though it has darkened just a tad. I think with age the case technology turns a little bit blue almost to counteract that, but it's definitely not UGLY over time. I drop my phone, uh, ALL the time. I'm a HUGE klutz. But my phone has not yet broken and the case has definitely stood the test of time so far. The case certainly has scratches and looks like it's been used for a year and a half, but it's not unattractive by any measure, and especially with the dark purple phone color, any darkening around the edges is hardly detectable until you take the case off the phone.The MagSafe aspect also works very well!! I use a popsocket wallet on the back of the case and it's combined my wallet and phone all in one. Whenever I get in the car, I take the popsocket wallet off and put the phone - case and all - on a MagSafe charger bank I got from WalMart and it charges while I'm driving, propped up nice and stable under the radio. It's really nice to have when I'm using Maps.This case is super convenient, durable, and ages well. Definitely the best option I've seen for a clear case on the market. I'm thinking about buying a phone stand from ESR since their case was so good.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars"
"12","Phone Case","ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear","somiya","The ESR Air Armor for iPhone 14 Pro Max is a phone case that seamlessly blends form and function, making it an excellent choice for the demanding user. I've seen a lot of claims of ""military-grade"" protection. However, the ESR Air Armor stands out from the rest.MagSafe with Muscle: Unlike most MagSafe cases, the Air Armor's HaloLock ring uses strategically placed, ultra-strong magnets. When I snapped my iPhone onto the case, I felt a satisfying click, and it stayed in place even during vigorous shakes.Drop-Defense Dynamo: ESR's signature Air-Guard corners are not just a gimmick. They are made from a blend of soft TPU and rigid polycarbonate, which effectively disperses impact forces. Although I wouldn't recommend skydiving with it, the Air Armor can handle everyday tumbles with ease.Crystal Clarity with a Catch: The transparent back of the case showcases the sleek design of the iPhone, and it is not prone to scratches like other cases. ESR coats it with a subtle yet effective scratch-resistant layer. However, over time there may be slight yellowing of the back.Verdict: If you are an iPhone 14 Pro Max user who prioritizes both protection and aesthetics, the ESR Air Armor is a no-brainer. Its robust build, MagSafe prowess, and clear back make it a compelling choice for those who are tech-savvy and accident-prone. Just be mindful of potential yellowing over time. Highly Recommend.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Magnet back works great. Clear backing is perfect for my work property sticker to be visible. And this thing protects my phone from the unfortunate falls it constantly faces. Raised edges proxy the face and strong back side caused rear iPhone glass to crack. Reinforced corners have been amazing and for the price‚Ä¶you absolutely can not beat it. Protects like high end expensive cases but also keeps the bulk off the phone. Only thing missing is just a rubber texture along the sides to provide more grip rather being smooth to the touch. Either way I love it!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"15","Phone Case","ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear","J. Romero","I recently purchased the transparent iPhone 14 Pro Max case with MagSafe, and while I'm overall satisfied with its performance, there is one noticeable drawback that has become apparent after just a month of use.Let's start with the positives. The build quality of this case is excellent. It's well-constructed, fits the phone perfectly, and the MagSafe feature is a great addition for effortless accessory attachment. The buttons and port cutouts are precise, offering easy access to all essential functions without any hindrance. Plus, it's reassuring to know that my valuable iPhone is protected by a sturdy case that can withstand accidental drops and bumps.The transparency of the case initially impressed me. When I first purchased it, my iPhone's sleek design was beautifully showcased, and I could admire the device's elegance. The MagSafe components are also smoothly integrated into the case, giving it a clean and polished look.However, my enthusiasm has been somewhat dampened by the fact that, after just a month of use, the transparency of the case has notably diminished. It's not as crystal clear as it was when I first got it. The case has become slightly cloudy, which has taken away from the visual appeal of my iPhone. It's disappointing because I specifically chose this case to showcase my device, and now it falls short in that aspect.That said, the reduced transparency doesn't impact the case's primary function, which is to protect the phone. It still performs this task admirably, and the MagSafe feature continues to work perfectly. So, while it might have lost some of its initial appeal, it still fulfills its core purpose.In conclusion, the transparent iPhone 14 Pro Max case with MagSafe is a high-quality product that excels in protecting your device and offers seamless MagSafe compatibility. However, the loss of transparency over time is a concern. If you prioritize protection and functionality over aesthetics, this case is a solid choice. But if you desire a case that remains crystal clear for an extended period, you might need to look elsewhere.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I do rotate between cases but I carry my phone in my hand a lot. I‚Äôve dropped my phone more times then I care to admit and unlike other cases this one had a bevel that downs let the screen protector get cracked unlike some other cases I have. The customer service is amazing. Had an issue with a hairline crack but it was more cosmetic and they are taking care of it. Again I drop my phone when I leave in my lap when I get up.

I have mine paired with a ESR magsafe wallet case with Find My and its worlds better than a case with a wallet slot. The wallet never comes detached unless i actually pull rather hard. This case is sleek and minimalistic while still seeming durable. I have fallen in love with the ESR lineup and ecosystem, you cannot beat them for quality and customer service! They quickly warrantied another case I had purchased for my iPhone 12 when the small magnet came detached from the case due to defective adhesion.

I‚Äôve had them that are so slick that I‚Äôve dropped the phone and cracked a screen protector, and another one that was almost like Velcro, which made it sticky going in and out of my pocket.This case is just right.

I also wanted to show off my new phone in Red.  Chose ESR for the many positive reviews and what appeared to be a good grip on either side of the case.  The only issue I am having is the back of the case, perhaps because of the materials, gets easily oily from holding the phone for long periods of time.

I had purchased some other cases for my iPhone 14 Pro Max that didn't have the mag-safe thing and they were fine- until I purchased an Anker battery that can magnetically attach to the back of my phone and charge it wirelessly.  BTW... The Anker battery is really good and convenient.  I digress.I bought the battery for my wife and she has the same phone, but we bought her case with the mag-safe at the Apple store for $40 (I think it's a Speck and a really good case). But I'm cheap so when I saw this case with the mag-safe at the price listed I had to jump on it.  I'm not disappointed.  The battery clamps on as well as on her expensive case.  It's relatively grippy, but I may improve the grip with the following method that I've used before (which I discovered is great to hang onto guitar picks..Take a box knife or blade and score the sides of the case diagonally in one direction, then in the opposite direction essentially putting ""X's"" down the sides of the case.  You really won't see the score marks but it will improve the grip significantly.  I did this on two of my previous cases and the method really works. Of course don't do this if you have any thoughts about returning the case... But I don't think you will as it's really good for the money and seems like very good protection for the phone.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Werner","This case is durable. I have dropped my phone a handful of times with this case and have had no issues. Not even a scratch on the screen. Call it luck if you‚Äôd like but it has landed face down every time. This case also holds really well on my car mount. I have to actually give a little yank to release it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

This case doesn‚Äôt slip in the hand like the iPhone with no case or even with a cheap silicone case. The extra material at the corners and the raised surrounding at the camera lenses work well to protect the phone from damage. The control buttons are easy to use and the cutouts are oversized at the power port and ring silencer.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
