"1","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","Elizabeth Richardson","I had been using a cheap pair of buds that I bought from Amazon and thought they were excellent. For my birthday I decided to updates to the Galaxy Buds to pair with my new Galaxy Phone. I was amazed at how much better they were than my old ones and especially love that the battery lasts a long time and also that the app provides me with so many options for customisation. Excrement happy.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 March 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars"

"4","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","Alexandrou99","Amazing sound quality, very convenient and robust touch features, and impressive noise cancelling and ambient sound modes.I had been concerned about purchasing this item based on a number of negative reviews related to the noise cancelling and sound quality, but I now understand that such reviews are most likely from ocd types with a superficial grasp on the topics of signal processing and electronic hardware.If you want absolute isolation to outside noise interference, opt for industrial grade ear plugs; noise cancellation is not a magic panacea.Moreover, for the physical size and price of these earbuds, the sound quality is quite impressive. You'd likely require in excess of several thousands of dollars for custom headphones if you're looking for studio quality sound.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 11 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"5","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","AllenXie","Pros:Sound Sensation: If you own a Samsung device that supports 24-bit audio, prepare to be wowed. The Buds Pro unleash rich, detailed soundscapes with booming bass, crisp highs, and a balanced midrange. It's an audiophile's dream come true (on compatible devices).ANC Allure: Active noise cancellation is top-notch, effectively blocking out ambient noise and letting you truly immerse yourself in your music or podcasts.Comfy Companions: The Buds Pro boast a snug yet comfortable fit, thanks to their ergonomic design and multiple ear tip sizes. You can wear them for hours without a hint of fatigue.Feature Fiesta: From seamless multi-device pairing to intuitive touch controls and an auto-ambient mode, the Buds Pro are packed with features that elevate your listening experience.Cons:The Samsung Catch: That glorious 24-bit audio magic? It's exclusive to Samsung devices. If you're rocking another brand, you're stuck with standard 16-bit sound, which, while decent, pales in comparison to the full potential of these buds.Battery Blues: Battery life isn't stellar, clocking in at around 5 hours with ANC on. Frequent charging might become your new normal.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 15 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"6","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","PeetL","I previously had the Sony XM4 earbuds, but I returned them after finding the controls were inconsistent, pairing missed some of the time, and they were uncomfortable.The Galaxy Buds seem to have solved all of these. They pair easily with my phone (also a Samsung), the touch controls are reliable and responsive. I especially love the ability to long-press one earbud to open and play Spotify, this removes the ""insert earbuds, get phone from pocket, unlock phone, start Spotify, put phone back"" dance.They're also very comfortable. I have big, sitcky-out ears and these are smaller and fit much more nicely than the Sony ones. Wearing them for several hours is fine.One area where the Sony ones win is noise canceling. The Galaxy Bud 2 Pros are pretty good, but the Sonys were better. If you want distraction-free listening, these are good enough. If you need to he absolutely cocooned with your music to the exclusion of everything else, these might not meet your needs.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 30 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"8","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","Buzzy","They fit nicely in my ears. The best earbuds I've had so far.  The only drawback is that the battery does not last very long. It will last for approximately 3 to 4 hours. To be able to use it for longer, I just use one earbud at a time and switch to the other when the battery runs low.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 21 February 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"20","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","Joshua","I love Samung products, ordered this one after many years of using Airpods Pro with my Galaxy Note 20. The mic quality is really good (which was rare in any in ear headphone except Airpods when using with iPhone). With this buds 2 pro, used it for calls with both ambient sound and ANC while walking on busy roads and the person on the other end couldn't hear any background noise.They do catch the wind noise (a bit) which you can hear but it doesn't pass it through so the person on the other end of the call don't get any wind noise either.Where it falls back is the ANC.It is significantly weak (especially comparing to Airpods Pro) and you can hear a lot of noise around you.None the less I do believe if you have a Samsung phone this is the better choice because of it's smooth integration with Samsung phones.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 10 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"21","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","Elizabeth Richardson","The product is great for general use, don't recommend for gym etc or small ears. Other than that, great product.

"23","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","Kenma","Picked the option for a slightly cheaper buds as Amazon advertising as box damaged but received a product from sri Lanka with missing eartips. So I guess now i loose my warranty for buying $40 cheaper 😞These sound quite sharp at first but had to tweak with the equaliser to find a good sound. These don't fit nicely with my ears as its loosens and potentially fall out if I'm not careful . ANC is on the weak side when walking on the street. Still can hear all the buses and cars and to combat this is to increase the volume which is not good for the ears","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 17 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"24","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","Thura A.","Received these earbuds three days after I ordered them. Very fast shipping!  The earbuds automatically connected to my Samsung Galaxy phone when I opened the case which amazed me! The quality of the sound was great. The active noise cancellation was ok. Sound from outside still quite ""loud"" even when the active noise cancellation was activated compared to my Bose overhead headphone with noise cancellation. As for the batteries, they lasted for 5 hours when I used them to watch TV continuously, not like what the box says from 5 - 18 hours playtime. But overall a pair of good earbuds.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"29","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","Joshua","So I'm a music fan, and I've tried many different headphones and buds over the years.  My last pair were the Jabra Elite 7, which is fantastic, I've since lost them, and the lack of a find me feature is a pain.  So I bought the Samsung Buds.  Ok,  sound quality 9/10, ANC 8/10, ambient mode 10/10, build quality 10/10The ambient mode is impressive; I can hear better with the buds in, especially if you turn on the boost mode.All in all, they're pretty good.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 16 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"32","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","Kenma","I had samsung galaxy buds pro before, and as far as I remember, it sounds good even with instrumentals. But this one? Doesn't fit my lifestyle. I thought that my razer earbuds will finally be replaced due to its shitty connection, but nah, I still prefer to have intermittent connection issues than hearing grainy instruments ☹️.PROs:- good voice quality- bunch of features- complete accessories- cheaper than any other storesCONs:- rock & anime music sucks here as instrumentals sounded like in an average earbuds. It has grainy, or static-like sound in it.

"36","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","Rob","I am up to my second pair after returning my first pair due to one of the earphones ear detection failing in one ear (this meant that ANC, pass through and the touch controls on that earphone stopped working). My current pair now has this horrific mic feedback screaching noise in the left earphone that happens whenever you have ANC or passthrough on. The most infuriating part is that this has happened over the course of 2 months with the first pair lasting less then 2 weeks, and the second lasting about a month and a half, and this is compared to my Buds+ (an earlier model) that have lasted over 4 years. I don't get how Samsung products are getting both more expensive with less quality.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 22 January 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"38","Electronics","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite","Peter M.","Initially for the first few months, this worked well. In the past month, no matter what I've tried (resetting, repairing, recharging etc.) the earphones have started to create this constant buzzing noise which is 10x worse when I turn on active noise cancellation. It sounds like terrible radio static and from googling, it appears many people have also had this issue. Initially it was good for music, now it just sucks. It does pick up a lot on background noise when you're on phone calls though.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
