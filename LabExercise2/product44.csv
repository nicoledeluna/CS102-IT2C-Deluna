These things are great coming in different sizes. Most computers seem to have a SanDisk card slot and so really handy to use with no extra card readers to buy for immediate action. Read and write times seem adequately fast too. Great as an off-site backup unit too being quite small and handy. Like all “hard drives however they can fail so make sure you have got at least two copies of your data current and up-to-date.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 12 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Without the official card reader which needs an extra amount to pay, the read speed via a standard laptop built-in UHS-I card reader is nearly 90MB/s, and the write speed is close to its official claim and there is so far no issue rised on my RX100M6 recording at 4K30fps. I couldn't feel any difference between it and its last generation 256G 170MB/s card, except the doubled capacity. As its price has been dropping since its launch just few months ago, it would be more valuable once costing less than 100 bucks.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

WRONG. A fast card clears the cameras internal frame buffer much quicker and enables a longer frame burst. This was completely obvious when I went from an older slower card to this type. I couldn’t believe how much longer the camera would take to slow down on a rapid fire burst. Nikon D610 with dual backup RAW config. Very happy.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 5 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
