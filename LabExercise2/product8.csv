"7","Sling Bag","D'Addario Pro-Winder String Winder and Cutter","Happy Shopping","No more having to carry wire cutters and string winders. This tool does it all. The cutter works really well, as do the post remover and string winder.  The only thing I don't like is that you have to open the cutters each time you wish to cut. If you're used to spring loaded wire cutters, this can be annoying at first.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 20 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
