"7","Books","Atomic Habits: the life-changing million-copy #1 bestseller Paperback ‚Äì International Edition, 18 October 2018","Mary","Atomic Habits review‚ÄúGet 1% better every day‚Äù.I am slightly biased in writing this review because prior to reading the book I already possessed a near religious belief in habits and how they impact our lives. Having read previous habit books like Charles Duhigg Power of Habits and Marshall Goldsmith ‚Äútriggers‚Äù, I felt I was at least relatively intermediate on my knowledge of the topic.Why did I read the book then? Because learning (or reinforcing learning) about habits is one of the most powerful ways for you to improve in the game of life. Your habits shape your destiny is one of my core beliefs so I am always happy to try to get a new ‚Äúedge‚Äù or ways to improve them. I alsoexpected to find new gems that would help reinforce the message of why habits are so powerful and I was not disappointed.But enough of my own habits and life, the question is whether you should read this book? The resounding answer is YES.Honestly, who doesn‚Äôt want to get better at something? Or who doesn't want to stop doing something?James Clear is a fantastic writer who I have followed his informative articles on a variety of topics for nearly a year. A lot of what is in the book is material he has written about on his website as other reviewers have stated but he puts it together in a very neat format for the book so even his regular readers should get something out of this. I actually took so many notes/highlights from the Kindle edition that I almost reached the publisher limit of 10% - a sign that I believe highly in what I am reading and want to reflect upon it for years to come.The opening pages of the book lay down a quote I will now repeat forever ‚Äúif you can get 1% better each day for one year, you‚Äôll end up thirty- seven times better by the time you‚Äôre done. Conversely, if you get 1% worse each day for one year, you‚Äôll decline nearly down to zero.‚Äù The beginning lays out why habits are so powerful and how habits shape who we are as people before getting into the HOW of starting to build better habits.The core of the book is based on the author‚Äôs ‚Äú4 Laws‚Äù of habit change - Make it obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy, Make it Satisfying‚Äù. By following the laws of habit creation we improve our chances of success in creating new habits.Without droning on too long, I must highly recommend this book. Even if you have no idea about what a habit is or if you are already advanced in the practising of habit change then this book will still teach you so much. If not just a refresher on the topic to keep you motivated. Seriously, anyone of any age could benefit from this book. It gives you the tools to start thinking more clearly about your life and improving it. I would recommend it to anyone over the other habit books I have read (see above) as it is relatively short and provides the ‚Äúhow to‚Äù parts on a silver platter.I will end my post on a few excellent quotes of the book towards the end (Ch.19 ‚ÄùHow to Stay Motivated‚Äù as this is the golden question for once you finish the book. A coach was asked by Clear what is the difference between the best athletes and everyone else? The coach said: ‚Äòthe factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn‚Äôt expecting: ‚ÄúAt some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.‚Äù‚ÄúMastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have been made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade.It is a fantastic book but the key thing will be can you then translate that into action? The book gives you the best leg up you can get - it‚Äôs then up to you to turn knowledge into action and go and get 1% better every darn day.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 21 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"8","Books","Atomic Habits: the life-changing million-copy #1 bestseller Paperback ‚Äì International Edition, 18 October 2018","Stephen Farrington","I chanced upon James Clears‚Äô blog on a random Google search for my ‚ÄúNext Book to Read‚Äù. After checking his list of recommendations, I read a few of his posts and I was hooked. The writing was easy to read and understand, his research thorough and reading his posts felt like having a personal life coach cheering you from afar.When I saw Atomic Habits listed on his website, I was very keen to read it. Fast forward 6 months, I finally purchased the kindle version and I am thrilled with it. The book follows his usual style of writing ‚Äì which is crisp, easy to read and packs a punch. There are actionable insights in the book, that when implemented consistently, can bring about significant changes in our lives. No task seems too big to achieve ‚Äì ask anyone who has tried building a new habit or deleting an old one from their lives, how difficult it is to keep at it for 21 days or 60 or 90 (depending on which literature you‚Äôre reading). But the methods listed in this book can allow you to overcome failure just as easily as they encourage you to successfully implement new habits.The ideas listed in the book are forgiving and generous, quite literally, where some ask you to focus on incremental gains, some don‚Äôt reprimand you for missing one day of a new diet / workout schedule, others give you simple, straightforward suggestions to increase your chances of success in implementing new habits.There‚Äôs no long story, scientific jargon, unnecessary fillers or flimsy writing to make you NOT want to turn the page. This is definitely worth your money and time.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 21 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

You can apply his teachings and layer habits.The revelation that you identify your values and beliefs before you establish your processes/systems and finally your goals(which are only indicators, as in the words of Simon Sinek, the game is infinite) was the biggest game changer for my wife and I.As a suggestion from a mate, I downloaded both the audible file and bought the physical book. The lessons sunk in by reading the book and listening to James read it to you. Expensive exercise, but fully worth it.One exceptional thing James does in his writing, are the ‚Äúhero sentences‚Äù at the start of a paragraph. You know what the paragraph is about from the beginning and your brain is ready to absorb the concepts because it knows the context and purpose from the onset.Invest in yourself and buy this book.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 March 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars"

A great read, well explained, with perfect stories and anecdotes to make the ideas very sticky. Recommended without reservation. 5 out of 5.Unfortunately, the print version I received was trash. There are a large number of editing issues, spelling mistakes, and grammatical issues. I found this to be extremely distracting. 1 out of 5.It was as if the publisher had scanned and OCR'd another copy and printed it without any proofing. Words like 'clear' became 'dear.' Incorrect capitalisation, and missing full stops. I have seen other fake copies of books in the past, but this is among the worst I have seen.

"16","Books","Atomic Habits: the life-changing million-copy #1 bestseller Paperback ‚Äì International Edition, 18 October 2018","Daryl","Although a large percentage of the 2300 plus books I have read since January 2000 are audio, mostly from Audible, I feel this is a case where you need a print edition.  With non-fiction books I like to mark the margin in pencil to identify key points, then create my own index, and that is certainly the case here.  Although James provides a chapter summary, which is most useful, the items that have relevance for you are worth noting.  James kindly sent me chapter 1, as he no doubt did to tens of thousands on his mailing list.  I found this most interesting and prompted me to buy two copies (one to loan to friends) in due course.  On reflection it occurred to me that there are 1440 minutes in the day, 1% being 14.4 minutes.  Round that up to 15 minutes ‚Äì a quarter of an hour.  All of us can devote 1% a day to a desired project, and over time that adds up.  I decided that apart from whatever else I was doing in the writing field, preparing my novel THE PRICE TO PAY and a collection of 25 short stories ‚Äì THE FORK IN THE ROAD ‚Äì to go on Kindle, etc. I would devote 1% a day to writing a new short story.  Consequently, since the end of October 2018 I have written 8 stories with a word count of a bit over 38,000 words.  I do acknowledge that when the creative process is upon me and I am nearing the end I might get up at 4:30 am and write for a couple of hours, but it has been an excellent discipline.  I believe that anyone who wants to improve their productivity, refine the process by which they achieve this and become more efficient in achieving your goals, ATOMIC HABITS is a book to read, then read again and again.  Thank you James for your excellent ‚ÄòGiving Attitude‚Äô ‚Äì you deserve all your success and are entitled to enjoy both the tangible and the intangible moments as you pass the markers along Success Road.Eric J Drysdale ‚Äì em:  ericjdrysdale@gmail.com","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 2 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"22","Books","Atomic Habits: the life-changing million-copy #1 bestseller Paperback ‚Äì International Edition, 18 October 2018","Daryl","Though well-written, this book seems to be more of a rather premature autobiography of a 20-something year old wealthy white male.Granted, he has overcome some first-world adversity, but I found the underlying message to be repetitive and better suited to teenagers or young adults who lack drive and direction.The underlying message, over and over (and over) is to persist with positive behaviours and they will eventually become a habit.It is well-studied that if you repeat an action 27 days in a row, it becomes a habit. That is the general crux of this book and I thought this was something most people already knew.It also appeared to me that the author has lived quite a privileged life and doesn't seem to yet understand what lifelong adversity is via lower to middle-class cards most of us are dealt in life, so if you are 30+ and have suffered many setbacks in life because you didn't win the 'family lottery', you will likely find this book mildly irritating.I personally found this book useless as I do not lack drive or ambition at all and unfortunately can't relate to a wealthy high-school jock who hurt himself playing a notoriously dangerous sport.I'll probably keep it for when my son starts reading novels.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 24 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The very small incremental improvements we can make in our lives not only add up Over time and done so gradually it takes no effort or feelings of deprivation (when losing a bad habit) but COMPOUND, i.e. we earn interest on our interest.  I have never been good at goal setting and I severely lack motivation.... or so I thought until I read this book.Now, I am eating really healthily, exercising (something that used to be an effort), I have switched my bottle of wine a night habit to herbal tea and I look and feel like a different person.

James has an extremely direct and readable style. He's clearly a student of human nature and uses a wealth of examples that can give you enough to get started with immediately.The opening story of an injury from baseball may be traumatising for some squeamish readers, but it shows the amazing courage that James had as a very young man. I believe his extraordinary dedication and fidelity to writing and to learning about how we make or break our habits was enough to give this long-lasting gift of this book to the world.Atomic Habits seems to be perfectly tailored to this age of distraction, and he gives advice for everybody on how they can rise above the clutter and noise.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 March 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars"
