"6","clothing","Champion Women's Classic Tee","Amazon Customer","For the size chart- go by your apparel size rather than measurements. I normally wear size 10 so could have ordered a med or large... but my bust is 42inches so I got XL and the shirt is huge on me lol it's like a men's XL. Still happy. The light purple is so pretty. I would order another one in a smaller size but they sold out :(","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 24 February 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"7","clothing","Champion Women's Classic Tee","Annie","Love Champion classic tees. This is my 3rd and will probably get more.  Soft  fabric that holds its shape after many washes.  I prefer the Classic over the Boyfriend tee, for the fabric is a little thinner and much softer.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 8 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

They fit well although I did size up as they shrink a tiny bit in the dryer (but not enough to really make a huge difference).

"30","clothing","Champion Women's Classic Tee","Shirley","I already own a similar Champion t-shirt in white that I bought somewhere else.  I thought this would fit the same considering it‚Äôs the same brand, it doesn‚Äôt.  Like the other reviews, it is a small fit and the quality of the t-shirt is also different, it‚Äôs a lighter cotton.  Disappointed, I had purchased 2, grey and black, they are both going back.  I bought a medium, maybe a large would have been better.  For reference, I usually buy small at Old Navy and Gap and a size 6 Top at Lululemon","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 17 July 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"49","clothing","Champion Women's Classic Tee","Lindsey B.","I have been super impressed with Champion gear as of late. I bought these in both black + white, they‚Äôre both perfect! I like tees to have a bit of a fitted shape so they don‚Äôt look like ‚Äúpajama shirts‚Äù but I‚Äôm not looking for the slim-cut fitted women's style either - these tees hit the mark.I had gained some weight during the first 1.5yrs of the pandemic & in my 30s, I‚Äôm struggling to lose the last 25lbs. So shopping for summer isn‚Äôt always a fun experience as I am not into tank tops as much, don‚Äôt want super tight & uncomfortable tops either. I had also bought two long-sleeve hooded tops from champion & I loved the fit of those so I was banking on these fitting the same. The tees are a mid-weight, good for summer but also good to hold their shape and not cling to your body. I could see my bra thru the white tee but it wasn‚Äôt gratuitous in the least. They hit a bit below my waist (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù) so I can wear them with leggings but I can also tuck in the front a little bit too.I love these shirts & especially for such an excellent price. If you‚Äôre looking for a tee that can be used for all sorts of outfits, these are it. I wore the white tee with navy capri fitted joggers, earrings + necklace, & white adidas sneakers and I could have definitely dressed the top up more - super versatile!TL;DR - 4.5/5 stars - 0.5 star loss due to slight see-thru on the white color tee","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 June 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Goorin siempre incluye 3 etiquetas peque√±as que si se busca por la p√°gina se encuentra la gorra. Deseo la devoluci√≥n de mi dinero lo antes posible.
