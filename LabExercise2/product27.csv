The only real issues I've had with it is the stock head strap and its comfort but I will be getting a new one tomorrow! Other than that everything else has been great got it in a day, quality is good, was cheap to buy to get into VR and its easy as to use. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a first VR headset!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"4","Electronics","Meta Quest 2 â€” Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset â€” 128 GB","Robbie","First of all, while I have spent hundreds of dollars on games, both on Steam and from the Oculus store, I don't play them for hours on end, and normally have small sessions, so I may not be too bothered by a lot of the issues presented by other reviewers. Each session could just be a few minutes to perhaps 30 minutes, but so far nothing longer than that. The battery normally last multiple sessions at least. Another thing is that the $479 cost seems perfectly reasonable to me and although my playtime is short I still personally get value out of it.-Build quality is fine with me.-Strap is fine with me, easy enough to adjust, holds the headset in position on my head/face, during my short sessions I've not really encountered any issues with pain or comfort. I was considering buying a 3rd party strap but some reviews mention various quality issues which puts me off, plus I don't know if I really need one.-I wear glasses and initially I had some trouble getting the headset on/off, but seem to have adjusted now and during recent sessions I've have not been bothered with this. I've not really had much of an issue with foggy lenses so far.-The VR gaming experience is just awesome.-You have to log in with a Facebook account, which I was initially bothered by but in the end just let it go.-The VirtualDesktop app is something you can use to play SteamVR games and Oculus PC games wirelessly on your Quest2. You can get by with 2.4GHz wifi for some games, but you really need to use 5GHz for the best experience (some games were too jittery over 2.4GHz). You can use Airlink but the quality doesn't seem as good as VirtualDesktop from what I can see so far. Initially I had trouble getting wireless to work. I had to switch my Windows network to Private and ensure only one network adapter was present (I initially had a bunch of Hyper-V NICs installed for my VMs and for whatever reason they interferred and prevented me from finding my PC from the Quest2). If you're more skilled than I you can probably work out the reason and not be troubled by this.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 2 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"7","Electronics","Meta Quest 2 â€” Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset â€” 128 GB","Nosey","We've had COUNTLESS hours of fun playing this as a family!I cast it to our 65 inch Samsung TV so everyone can see what's going on in the headset and it's not just 1 parson enjoying the experience of VR.Family battles of Beat Saber are definitively the highlight.The games are reasonably priced and no in app purchases for the most part except for expansion packs for best saber and a few other games which are not that expensive.We've had hours of fun when friends come over and put on Richie's Plank Experience. There's not a lot to the game but it REALLY shows you the experience of flying in VR and can trigger some vertigo which is a lot of fun.Highly recommend upgrading the head strap to the BoBoVR which has magnetic drop in batteries for extended play.Also recommend a silicone face cushion replacement as you can get quite sweaty from exerting yourself.Protective adjustable grips also make a big improvement to the experience and protection of the controllers! Less likely to throw a controller in an immersive mil sim game thinking your throwing a grenade. LoLYou won't regret this purchase! Thank me with a thumbs up.There's HOURS of mind blowing fun to be had. YouTube also has a VR library full of content. Floating around the ISS, looking down at earth and out into the cosmos is mind blowing. Walking among dinosaurs is incredible! I could go on and on!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"8","Electronics","Meta Quest 2 â€” Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset â€” 128 GB","it arrived with the usb c cable that you plug into the headset snapped off and unusable","You genuinely do not need another device for the goggles to operate, though it will make it easier and extend functionality (like sharing a desktop screen of your Windows-based machine in Bigscreen app).There are still a lot of constraints - like a picture is not crisp, especially when you watch Youtube 8k and even 12k videos - cool to look around but the picture quality... not pleasant to an eye.3D though is awesome. Immersion effect - great. Gaming - worth it. Though you will find that there are not so many games to play in, actually. Some have a steep learning curve and a lot of bugs making the game annoying.You can't use them normally for business: screen sharing or even sharing a screen of goggle's apps inside another app - either very troublesome or impossible at all. Again, quality won't be the best. A lot of hindrances on the way. In comparison to just meeting in Zoom or similar desktop apps. And I still haven't figured out an easy way to use a keyboard while having multiple screens in goggles... So business features are still in very early development.To my surprise, not so many people are using VR, or same apps. So multiplayer is ok in some apps and totally unusable in others.But considering the price, if you can afford it, test it out! Probably you will leave those.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 19 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It's easy to work out, hand tracking and more abilities I'm still working through!Only downside I'm experiencing is that the headset can become a little tiresome as it is heavier than I'm used to but it's not enough to lower the 5 star rating here.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 24 March 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

He loves them, even knowing that the Quest 3 is now available and presumably has better, clearer vision. Battery life is the only down-side to this headset with a maximum 2-2 1/2 hours of play per charge and about 3 hours required to fully charge them.

"19","Electronics","Meta Quest 2 â€” Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset â€” 128 GB","peter","The headset itself is a 10/10 as a first experience for VR. Both myself and my partner have had oodles of fun with it. The PCVR wireless link is excellent, and the way it immerses you into the games and content is impeccable. I would absolutely recommend this headset as an affordable entry into the VR space, especially if you're curious but unsure.That being said, the accessories (mainly the default strap) are awful. I upgraded it rather quickly due to the pressure on my face, neck, and shoulders caused by this. In addition, the device does not come with the required microfibre cloth for cleaning the lenses. This is a bit of a poor oversight on Meta's part in my opinion, as the lenses are pretty easy to smudge.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 27 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

And the amount of programs on Meta for this VR platform is fantastic and is getting better and better. I found the optics in this headset really annoying - the Fresnel lenses allowed only a small window of vision, much like my patients complaining about looking through the basic multifocal lenses. And the headstrap was just terrible. The headset was front heavy and it was uncomfortable to wear. I ended up returning it and buying the Quest 3 - definitely a better upgrade. Still not perfect, but much better. You'd need to buy a separate headstrap as the stock on supplied by Meta on Quest 2 and Quest 3 were terrible","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"38","Electronics","Meta Quest 2 â€” Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset â€” 128 GB","ScutterButter","First time trying VR and have been addicted ever since. There's lots of different apps to explore so you could spend LOTS of time playing different games. I tend to play an hour of Beat Saber 3-4 times a week. The golf game and shooter game this pack comes with are alright. But I don't play them much. Sometimes it does crash and you have to wait for it to come back, but it's not long. And if the guardian boundary floor level doesn't want to set right, it's best just to restart the device. There have been a few hiccups here and there but they are minor. Can be used with glasses with the insert they provide. The rubber cover for the foam part can be used if you are playing games where you sweat. Easily cleaned afterwards. Glasses might fog if you take off the occulus and back on again during physical activity. Overall I'm quite happy with it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 7 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

You can even watch Netflix and do internet. You could spend the day in this relaxing in your massage chair. However I do find the head needs a break from it as it can get sweaty and a little sore after long periods, however after market options have more comfortable head rests etc. Some games can even give you a bit of a work out. the interface of the thing really gets you into it, like the sword games, you wont just flick your wrists and hit things, you will get into a full swing like your actually swinging a sword. It has truly been designed well and has a great option of content that's free to the latest expensive games, but this can be used for far more than gaming.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 11 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"41","Electronics","Meta Quest 2 â€” Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset â€” 128 GB","Fledgling Urbanist","I've been wanting to grab an Oculus 2 for awhile now aand eventually bit the bullet. I have dabbled in VR when I got a Gear VR for Samsung and that was pretty decent for it's time and I've also owned a PSVR in the past. I've only used the Oculus for a couple of hours and I have to say that it is a great piece of equipment.I like the fact that you can take it anywhere and play., The screen is nice and clear and I can't see any scren door effect. I've only played Beatsaber, Rollercoaster game and Saint's & Sinners. It takes some getting used to regarding movement and it was causing some nausea with Saints & Sinners, no issues with Beatsaber. I guess it's to do with looking around and moving at the same time. I suspect I will get used to it over time.The sound is nice and clear too, I wasn't expecting it to sound that good. You can still hear if someone is talking to you and yet enough to be immersed in the game. The headset strap isn't much of an issue for me although I can see how people feel like it's too tight for them, pushing against the face.I will definitely be grabbing a link cable so I can play using my PC and will look at other accessories too.No regrets.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 9 June 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars"

Parental controls are difficult to setup or impossible to get working. I purchased some apps on a parent account and used the 'Share Apps' function so my kids could play on their account. Turns out many apps need to be purchased again on each account. Not great news for some apps that cost $80+.Also kids need their own account, and if there are 10-12 they have really limited options. They can only access G games, not PG. There is no option to allow PG games from the parent account. Apparently this is because under 13 shouldn't really play online/VR games.

"45","Electronics","Meta Quest 2 â€” Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset â€” 128 GB","Rob Burgess","After all my research on the Oculus Quest 2, Amazon Prime was the best possible deal. The price may sting for some, I was lucky enough to have a gift card to help me out. The experience for what you get out of it is worth it though.It's absolutely true that the headset strap is hella uncomfortable after playing for some time and troublesome to adjust but there's an alternative you can buy - the elite strap. My purchase included the silicone cover which I completely forgot to put on the foam pad, so I can't quite say yet how that feels like but anything is better than the default foam pad.Another negative jab is at Facebook itself. There does not seem to be a way to play the Oculus without having a Facebook profile. This shouldn't be forced upon users who wish to play a VR headset and have fun. At the end of the day, Facebook (or should I say Meta) has implemented this to help improve the product. There is no need to worry about privacy as you can hide your activity in your settings.I bought Resident Evil 4 VR for this headset and it'll be the only game I buy on the Oculus. There's no shortage of games but they are pricey and it's still early days for their library. The rest of my VR games will be played on Steam using the Oculus Quest 2.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 18 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
