"2","Phone Accesorries","Apple AirTag 4 Pack","Michael Barlow","I had one of these in my suitcase, which went missing at the airport. It allowed me to set off an alarm, and track it.I also found it useful in finding my way back to my hotel. It was quicker to get directions this way, in maps, rather than entering hotel detailsIt works off “find my phone” on iPhone.Apparently there is also an in Google play store.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 31 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"8","Phone Accesorries","Apple AirTag 4 Pack","Simon Hudson","I bought these for tracking my checked luggage when flying. The first time I used them, our two checked bags were too heavy, so we had to move some items to a standby duffel. I set up a third unactivated airtag to use in the duffel in the airport in a few seconds, and was able to track all three bags through a number of flight changes.  It is reassuring to watch my bags making tight connections.These are remarkably easy to set up, and tracking is straightforward.I gave a few to my children, then bought more to put in our cars - not sure if I should be doing this but car theft is a real problem where I live and some people have been able to locate their stolen cars.Then i bought more for my carry on luggage that sometimes ends up in the hold at the last minute.  I had an experience where the airline staff couldn’t locate my carry on after a flight, so if this happens again, I will be in a better position to locate my bag.If airtags had been around before my dog died, It would have been helpful to find him when he decided to go on a “dog’s” night out”I recommend buying silicone holders in multiple colors as this helps to keep track of which airtag is which.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 29 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"9","Phone Accesorries","Apple AirTag 4 Pack","Ann-Marie Corradini","Massively expensive for what they are, but hey the Apple tax means people will pay it. Doesn't help there is little else like it, unless you want to buy a bunch of mobile phone sim cards, keep paying the bill for each item you want to be able to find etc.Did have issues trying to connect one of these, not sure why but it just refused to work.Also beware you MUST have an apple device to set these up now, Android no longer can, plus only way Android can USE these is via the find my phone website, the big plus though is Android does have a great app to scan for nearby AirTags, I recommend everyone with an Android phone to get it, especially if you live alone, vulnerable or have a stalker as these things are scarily small and can easily be slipped into someone's belonging or vehicle. Not saying this to scare anyone rather as a bit of a PSA so people are aware and can stay safe.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 29 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"49","Phone Accesorries","Apple AirTag 4 Pack","Mozzer","Love these!I bought these to attach to my trailer as my previous trailer was stolen. With the right attachment you could put them anywhere!My iPad locates seamlessly. My Android (Samsung) phone even notifies me of a tracker following me, which was a surprise because all the videos I'd watched on YT said that the Android community would never know if an Apple tracker was unknowingly following them.The volume is a hit and miss.....not loud enough if searching for a tracker attached to a set of keys the may have lodged in the couch cushions, but too loud if you've got it in your car (to track the car) so the theif would hear it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 26 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"50","Phone Accesorries","Apple AirTag 4 Pack","Carl Thomson","We left our luggage in storage on day trips while traveling around Europe. I popped an AirTag in each bag and the app allowed me to travel them and gave me piece of mind. I also kept one in my sling and my wife’s handbag, just in case we left them behind somewhere or they were stolen we could at least try to track them. They are so accurate that I was able to detect them down to less than a meter away. Once you’re finished with them, you can easily take the battery out and store them away. If you’re worried about keeping track of your gear, this is a must have.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 29 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
