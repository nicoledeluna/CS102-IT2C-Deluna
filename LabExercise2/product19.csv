Very soft with lots of stretch. But does not stretch out, the stretch bounces right back. I'm sure I will be wearing it a lot this spring and summer.

Puedes salir a la calle o al parque, subir y bajar escaleras sin temor de que se te vea tu panty. Si algo pudiera observarse es que es una falda construida sobre un short y por tanto queda un poco gruesa la prenda, fuera de ello est√° muy bien y uno luce informal pero bien vestida.

Washed it three times- don‚Äôt wash it with anything else or that item will take on the chemical smell.Other than that, order a size up as recommended by others. There is some stretch/forgiveness.

Purchased this jean skirt for a bachelorette party. Sadly my package was delayed by Amazon so I wasn't able to wear it for the party, but I did get to wear it later for this review. The skirt has some positive features, but there are a few drawbacks worth considering before hitting ""Buy Now"". Firstly, I absolutely loved the soft and stretchable material. It is 70% cotton which is fabulous. It easily formed around my body, providing a comfortable fit that would likely suit various body shapes. The functioning pockets were a practical addition and are pretty deep. I could definitely fit my smartphone. I also appreciate the side slit, which adds that extra something and makes the skirt pop more. The inclusion of shorts underneath is a God sent, ensuring I don't accidentally give anyone a sneak peek while sitting and moving around.As I mentioned there were a couple of downsides to note. Firstly, the price seemed a bit steep at $31, especially considering it is a no-name brand on Amazon. With so many other no-name online clothing suppliers $31 isn't realistic for this skirt in my opinion. Additionally, as someone with thicker thighs, I experienced some issues with the shorts riding up slightly in the groin area while walking, requiring occasional readjustment. Another drawback was a weird fold that occurred in the lower back area with the fabric, which wasn't a huge deal but is somewhat unflattering especially considering how much I'm paying for this skirt. Overall the skirt was a great material and I love the design but this is simply not worth the price in my opinion, I think $20 would be more reasonable for this skirt.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 June 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"12","Skirt","luvamia Skorts Skirts for Women Denim Mini Skirt Side Slit with High Waisted Jean Shorts Stretchy","Leah Anestos","So I bought these back in August, and they became a staple in my wardrobe. However they only got worn as soon as I got them, through September & October and have been put away ironed ready for the weather to warm up. I put them and realized they fit different and the v flap is super stretched so the side of it looks odd. I also had that my flap looks like it‚Äôs constantly down, and I have to constantly re adjust that, the flap, and keeping the pants from riding up. The shorts underneath are not staying in place like before. now just walking around my house I am fighting this article of clothing just to look/feel normalOriginal post:If you want the skirt without the shorts showing on the slit it‚Äôs very easy to just pull up the shorts a little bit. These are super stretchy and you don‚Äôt have to worry about constantly having to pull them down because the shorts help it stay in place.

"29","Skirt","luvamia Skorts Skirts for Women Denim Mini Skirt Side Slit with High Waisted Jean Shorts Stretchy","Brenda LaPrime","This fit perfectly and was so comfortable! The material is stretchy so it's great for curves, especially if your hips and thighs are wider than your waist. It doesn't ride up too much and the shorts underneath help keep it from flashing everyone. I usually wear a size 8 in jeans/bottoms, and the Medium was a good fit.Truly my only complaint is that it smells verrrrry chemically. I didn't have time to wash before I first wore it and I thought the smell would go away as I was at a concert and it was over 100 outside, but it didn't. I have washed it twice since and the smell is still there and has given my other clothes the smell. I plan to wash one more time after soaking so I hope the smell goes away then.TL;DR - fits great for curves, very intense chemical smell that has not gone away after 2 washes","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 11 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

A day later it didn‚Äôt update any shipping information and I cancelled the delivery. It then said I refused delivery again.
