I purchase this for my son when his Poppy died and it helped him understand whats happening in a way a child can intepret/understand.

"45","Book","The Invisible String: 1 Paperback ‚Äì Picture Book, 11 December 2018","Vanessa Ferreira Dias da Silva","If you're going to have any book in your kid's library, I highly recommend The Invisible String. It explains in gentle and simple terms that we are all connected by an invisible string of love, whether we are separated by long-distance, only a few hours and even with pets and people who have passed on. If you have a child who struggles with separation anxiety at school or at daycare, this book is the perfect way to help them understand that even though you're separated for a few hours, you're still connected by love. It's also a good way to teach kids about death in a gentle way, that even though animals and people are no longer with us on Earth, they are still connected to them by this invisible string. I especially love how at the end (SPOILER ALERT) it explains how everyone in the world in connected as one. <3","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Brazil on 28 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"
