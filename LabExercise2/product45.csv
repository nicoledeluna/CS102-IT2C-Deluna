Connect the land line and power and it's ready to go. If you're looking at other RJ45 splitters with no power supply, don't bother. Buy this one instead. I've got those cheap under $8 ""Y"" shaped splitters and they don't work. This one works great. Mind it can connect up to 4 devices at the same time, one of the slots is for the land line.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 17 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"8","Electronics","TP-Link LiteWave 5-Port Gigabit Desktop Switch, Plastic Case, 0/100/1000Mbps, Networking Switch, Auto-Negotiation, RJ45 Port, Plug and Play (LS1005G)","John R","These switches are pretty awesome and great value for money, they're almost as cheap as unbranded switches, but are actually from a known brand. They're also very stable, I've never had to reboot them because of a network issue. In terms of speed, I was initially confused as I was only getting around 500 mbps during file transfers, but as it turned out, Windows file sharing kind of sux, I've since switched to doing file transfers over SSH/SFTP and now I get the full gigabit speed this switch supports. I've actually purchased three of the 5 port switches and one 8 port switch, so that should be an indication of how much I like these switches. Be very careful when buying, the white version is not just cheaper because of its colour, it's a 100mbps switch, not a gigabit switch like the black one. Also remember to get CAT6 cables so you get the full speed these switches offer.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 7 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It works really well and has very high speeds. It worked well with my internet as I was constantly getting 100mbs across all devices. The box itself is quite small only being about 15cm x 8cm. It requires a direct connection to an outlet so make sure you have one available. You can put the Ethernet cable from your modem into any of the ports and it will still work.

In this case, prosumer clients - with logging of interface changes, that were completely stable on a 10/100 hub reported link transitions multiple times (between 5 and 10) a day.Since the purpose of the device was to increase throughput for video storage and playback (from the successor to the ReadyNAS NAS), link transitions are unacceptable.While the switch purchase was a disappointment, Amazon and Australia Post (return delivery) excelled themselves. Aus Post had the parcel back to Amazon in less than 2 days and Amazon had processed the refund in less than a day afterward (the purchase price was credited to my account about 2 days after I put the parcel in the letter box.)I have decided after this experience that a small 2nd hand enterprise switch (those famous names like Cisco) is better suited to my needs.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 22 July 2023","2.0 out of 5 stars"
