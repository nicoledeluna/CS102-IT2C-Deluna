We have some great local walks in woods and by the river with frequent sightings of various wildlife. I could never get any decent shots on my phone as subjects were too far away and I rarely carried my bridge camera with 30x zoom as it was too bulky for everyday use.I am delighted with the Canon powershot sx740hs as it provides a semi serious camera with a powerful zoom and pops right in my trouser pocket.I read somewhere that the best way to get good photos is to have your camera on you and use it frequently. I am now able to take it every time I go out.I'm impressed by the 40x zoom which even hand held provides decent results due to the image stabilisation.I'm a casual photographer (definitely not pro and a still a good few steps down from decent amateur) but this camera lets me step out of the full auto mode as a starting point. It isn't as versatile as my bridge with regard to settings and can't take filters but it allows me to carry a camera every day which is great. It will be so easy to pack for holidays and hillwalking too, although the lack of weather proofing is a bit of a set back in the hills (I just keep it in a zip lock good bag if rain is forecast and wouldn't have it out to shoot in the wet anyway).Great compact camera for the price. Battery life is okay so far although my bridge camera takes AA batteries which would have been nice as it is easy to carry spared of those. An actual Canon spare battery is a bit too expensive.I've added some shots (most taken at full zoom) none of which I would have got with my phone and as for my bridge, well I'd have probably left that at home üòâüôÇ.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Ich hatte zuvor das Vorg√§ngermodel. In meinem Hobby, der Event-u.Naturfotografie, ist die Kamera f√ºr mich zu einer unverzichtbaren Erg√§nzung zu meiner DSLR. Der gewaltige Zoom erm√∂glicht Aufnahmen, als wenn man neben den Akteuren stehen w√ºrde. Ich sage immer, man kann aus 300m Entfernung die Nasenhaare eines Menschen messerscharf ablichten. Wahnsinn!. Im Sportmodus und mit kurzen Verschlu√üzeiten ist sie dennoch lichtstark genug und kommt hier ohne Blitz aus. Im Eventbereich ist der Blitz sowieso nicht erforderlich, da B√ºhnenbereiche ausreichend ausgeleuchtet sind. Meine beste Naturaufnahme ist ein Seeadler im Flug, gestochen scharf, aus bestimmt 200m Entfernung, allerdings mit Stativ aufgenommen.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 9 July 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Perfekt geeignet f√ºr alle Feiern, um ganz besondere Fotos mit nur einem Klick zu bekommen, auch als absoluter Laie. Ich habe die Funktion geliebt. Diese gibt es jetzt nicht mehr bei der SX 740HS :( Stattdessen eine Funktion um Essen zu fotografieren. Da kommt bei mir innerliche Tristesse auf. Echt traurig! Auch die Funktionen, um automatisch bei Blinzeln oder L√§cheln zu fotografieren habe ich bisher nicht mehr gefunden. Insgesamt ist sie deutliche komplizierter in ihrer ganzen Handhabung als der Vorg√§nger. Aber: Einen Pluspunkt bekommt sie f√ºr die tollen Nahaufnahmen ohne Motiv, die trotz wackelnder Hand super scharf werden. Echt toll! Das konnte der Vorg√§nger nicht. Trotzdem fehlt mir der Spa√ü am Fotografieren, im Vergleich zum Vorg√§nger. Alles komplizierter und die Kamera deutlich schwerer und sperriger als der kleine Bruder.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 22 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I have an EOS with an assortment of lenses but it's the carrying of them around. This camera is a great 'little' camera to just have handy in the car, it's a bit heavier than I expected. Never bothered taking videos before, I somehow hit the wrong setting and recorded a few minutes but on playing it back on the computer I was satisfied with the result.

I paid ¬£359. As soon as I opened the packaging I knew there was a problem, the box looked old/worn. After I input the usual setting I then set about setting up the Wi Fi to transfer my photo's direct to my PC. However I noticed that the camera had been set up for Wi Fi in the past. This is because you can give it a ""Nickname"". And the ""NEW"" camera was registered as ""LUKE CAM"". Obviously the name of the person that had it before me. I contacted Canon and explained the situation and to see if it had been registered with them in the past, however it can take quite a while for them to reply.I though that I would try it out as I had already charged the battery. While the zoom function is good (one of the main reasons for buying this), the picture quality with and without zoom is just as good as I expected. I had an old Fuji F30 that has better results (but poor zoom function).I contacted the seller who apologised and advised me to return it and they would investigate the situation, well surely when they packed it they should have noticed the condition of the box. Makes me  wonder if this was deliberate or not.Now I'm without a camera as they never offered a replacement.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought it as a replacement for my Nikon S9900 which sadly wore out after years of good service. This is supposed to be my 'take everywhere' camera (there are times when taking a DSLR isn't very practical), but nowadays I rarely take it anywhere.The main reason for buying this was the 40x zoom, but I have found though that the image quality drops off very quickly after about 25x. For general shooting it's fine, but sadly general shooting isn't the key product feature of this camera.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 September 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I have taken beautiful pictures. The only complaint is the outdated WiFi/Bluetooth connection to transfer the data. It is a nightmare to set up and it is also a nightmare to use to transfer data. I bought an SD card reader for iPad Pro. Now I can have my photos transferred in seconds rather than in several minutes (plus several minutes before you are actually able to establish the connection.Dear Canon. It is 2020 to remind you. Nowadays, any wireless connection can be established with one click rather than a tedious set up process. Do something about it.Also, as mentioned by an other reviewer. Many people do not have a PC (it is 2020 again) and if you do not want to end up as Kodak you need to grasp that idea and think about the user who cannot download your files from a PC. We use tablets and smart phones today.There is no user manual to explain different functions. The given link to the website is messy and does not lead to the manual. I ended up watching a YouTube video explaining various functions.All in all, it is an excellent camera. Do not get discouraged with the messy connection.

My S10 plus constantly took significantly better photos as well as video, and for the price of this I just wasn't impressed or found myself in many situations using it over a quite phone snap.The canon poweshot had a good zoom, but realistically photos become very poor very fast when zoomed in and incredibly pixilated.The photos themselves are very soft and grainy. It struggles in low light and is very slow to focus. In direct sun, you get angled flare marks on photos which I couldn't prevent. In the same situations my S10 plus just massively outperformed it. It is a tribute I suppose to the progression of mobile photography and at the same time, made me realise after a day or two it became pointless using the camera.Night time photography was really difficult, even indoors with low lighting. This camera with the flash on made photos look somehow worse. Retro 80's weirdly.4k recording is okay, but at 30fps and a weird crop factor took away from the quality with awkward black boarders. Again my S10+ does wider angle and 4k 60fps and seemed clearer overall.There is no raw format despite tech sheet, so editing photo's isn't as good.It is a nifty camera overall though, small portable and easy to use. Excellent built quality. Just not enough to make me want to use it over a phone. Suppose should have gone DLSR.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 October 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The photos seem fine full frame, but as you zoom in for cropping or whatever, it's clear there is a lot to be desired here. Pictures are very noisy and lacking in closer detail, which is very strange indeed. I'm not sure I can live with it to be honest, although the rest of the camera build and quality is as good as it's ever been.The only detail of note so far is that pictures appear to be 72dpi whereas a photo from a comparable Sony camera were 350dpi. I'm not sure what actual difference this makes, but something is a bit off, either with the sensor or the software. I have updated the firmware to the latest version, but it is not designed to address the image quality problems. Not sure what to make of this oddball, considering the good track record of Canon's earlier models.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The problem I found is that it is not intuitive to select settings when in any other mode.  I printed out the complete instruction manual but it takes time to read and memorise all the possibilities. Without a separate eye level view finder this renders the camera to become a point and shoot and hope for the best one.

To be honest, it is a simple point and click camera and no better than that. The zoom is incredible but the quality of the images leaves a lot to desire. The lack of an EVF is a problem too because the screen is difficult to see in bright light and impossible in sun light. The worst aspect of this camera is the software which is truly terrible. Uploading images to smartphone is very fiddly and it can be slow to tell you what is happening. I have just spent 2 hours trying to copy a 4k video to phone/pc and have given up.

Easy and compact for my wife to use as she find's my dslrs' too heavy and bulky. The only downside is it doesn't shoot in raw, but that's a minor issue given the price.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Low light performance is very grainy, and not a patch on my G7X which is quite a few years old now.  My advice is spend more money if performance matters more than style.  It is surprisingly big as well, but credit to Amazon, they took it back.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 December 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The item arrived very quickly given the current situation, so no complaints from that side. The item was most definitley not brand new as it was unsealed and had finger marks on the screen and just obviously had been opened by someone else prior to me opening it.Furthermore the camera is only a slight improvement at best on almost any mobile phone on the market, and finally there was an issue with the lens opening/closing which made my decision to return the camera very easy.Thanks to Amazon for making the returns process easy and simple, but no thanks at all to the 'Canon' amazon seller for clearly not checking products before they are shipped.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 April 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars"
