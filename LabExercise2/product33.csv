"1","Gloves","THE NORTH FACE Etip Summit Gloves Navy","OfADifferentMind","I have purchased this type North Face e-tip gloves and used them daily in every season except summer since I got my very first iPhone more than 10 years ago. They are sturdy but not bulky, and the e-tips work well with my phone & tablet touch screens — and they keep working.The slight non-slip texturing on the palm & lower part of the fingers mean I can wear them while I drive & not worry about my hand sliding around while gripping the wheel. Other, cheaper gloves I tried that appear to be similar (especially when shopping online) either lacked the texturing — making them dangerously slippery when driving — or were overly grippy & required extra effort to release a hand to move it around on the steering wheel, which slowed my ability to respond quickly.They aren’t cheap, but they keep my arthritic hands fairly warm while enabling me to still use my phone — and these e-tips keep working, even under heavy use, unlike with the numerous other brands of cheaper gloves I’ve tried.The one trade off for the great touch screen capability is that they can’t be thicker & warmer ... but I & my husband really like that we can easily wear these inside of super warm, but super bulky snowboarding/skiing gloves.  These e-tip gloves are slippery enough that it’s easy to pull the bulky gloves on & off, and be able to instantly use a touch screen without having to be bare handed in single digit & sub-zero temperatures.The material also doesn’t easily absorb moisture from the outside — so you don’t end up with a cold & wet glove from just brushing some snow of your car’s side mirror ... and yet we’ve never had any problem with the gloves causing hands to get sweaty, so it seems like it does a good job of wicking away any inner moisture.I’ve purchased over a dozen pairs for myself & my husband in the last decade ... 2/3 of them for me because I keep losing gloves — and it’s almost always my right hand glove because there are times when I just need to have a slightly more refined touch/dexterity with my dominant hand than I can get with these, OR ANY of the other brands/models of gloves I’ve tried.  This isn’t the fault of the gloves —  I just include this to explain why I’ve purchased so many pairs of these gloves.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2021","4.4 out of 5 stars"

"10","Gloves","THE NORTH FACE Etip Summit Gloves Navy","Iskandar","Gives decent protection from the cold, but, not for more extreme temperatures; just as effective as putting your hands in your jacket pocket. You can indeed tap your phone's touch screen with these gloves, just not for precise touch screen actions.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Singapore on 1 January 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"11","Gloves","THE NORTH FACE Etip Summit Gloves Navy","Phil H.","Really needed a pair of gloves and these did a good enough job - at least initially. But within literally 3 uses the glove split along the middle finger seam. That's to be expected on a cheaper pair of gloves, not a $50 pair.Very disappointed in the quality here","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 26 April 2022","4.4 out of 5 stars"

"17","Gloves","THE NORTH FACE Etip Summit Gloves Navy","Abelix","Had the previous generation of these gloves that fit great. These run about a size small and the threadline runs right across the knuckles. Ordered a second pair one size up and was happy. Fixed the issue of going over the knuckles and easier to get on/off. Works well with touchscreens. Not for very cold weather, but a good every day glove and thin enough to retain some dexterity.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 September 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"25","Gloves","THE NORTH FACE Etip Summit Gloves Navy","ajay","BOTH the right and left gloves ripped at the seam along the pinky side of the hand on my very first trip out with them. It's extremely unfortunate, because otherwise they were incredibly comfortable, well-fitting gloves and the touch screen compatibility and dexterity were excellent. But, no number of good features can make up for a glove with a big hole...kind of defeats the purpose (although admittedly, my thumbs did stay pretty cozy).I didn't use the gloves for anything particularly tough on them, the tears on the seams both occurred while putting on/taking off the gloves. The wrist taper on them does not have much elasticity to it, which made it a little tough to pull them on/off. I tried to be careful in where I gripped and how I applied pressure, and it didn't seem like I was pulling particularly hard but was still greeted by the unpleasant sounds of popping stitching. The seam tears just worsened with each use of the gloves.The gloves fit perfectly once on, so the sizing seems correct. They just need some more 'give' in the wrist band, or some sort of improved reinforcement.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 March 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"33","Gloves","THE NORTH FACE Etip Summit Gloves Navy","DanielleD","Touchscreen receptive gloves that are decently warm. The wrist isn't as stretchy as the glove so I have a tough time putting it on but the glove itself fits great, is true to size and stretchy. Keeps my hands warm and not too thick as I able to zip or button with ease. I got a deal on the gloves but I wouldn't pay more than $30USD for these. Overall decent, cool not cold weather gloves.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"35","Gloves","THE NORTH FACE Etip Summit Gloves Navy","Mr. Daddy Jones","Gloves are nice and easy on the eyes. Texting is very good and haven't had any problems with the digital side. My only complaint is there just not that warm. I think winter gloves should 100% keep your hands well warm. They're perfect for 40 degree days. However when the weather really gets frigid they don't cut the mustard, would recommend but be aware of the weather factor.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 29 January 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"39","Gloves","THE NORTH FACE Etip Summit Gloves Navy","Isaiah","I didn't want to leave an inaccurate star rating, because I'm sure they are nice gloves when they fit as expected.  With most gloves, I can squeeze a medium on if needed, but these were size Large and I couldn't even get them past my fingers.  I bought these to replace a discontinued pair that I had purchased from REI.  They were the same brand, same ""L"" size, and nearly identical in appearance.  Somehow this style just runs SUPER small.  Probably order 1 or 2 sizes up?","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 5 December 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"40","Gloves","THE NORTH FACE Etip Summit Gloves Navy","Steven Medel","These are advertised for cold weather but as soon as you get them the packaging ranks them for “cool weather”.
