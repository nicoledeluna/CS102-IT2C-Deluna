"2","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Katie Mullins","The product looks nothing like the picture. The colour of the jumper is more yellow and the quality is not there. It looks really cheaply made. This material also attracts lint and animal fur like crazy. I wouldn’t recommend purchasing. Much better options out there.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"7","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Lindsey R.","Ignore the wrinkles, this was vacuum sealed and needs to be washed but I couldn’t wait to try it on!This is exactly what I was looking for - it’s very soft, medium weight and warm. I love the length as I was looking for something cozy but not super oversized and not cropped.I’m 5’6” 140 pounds and I ordered the small in the light gray.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 20 March 2024","2.0 out of 5 stars"

"9","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Kanata Girl","I wear it a lot but it’s fairly thin and the zipper looks and feels pretty cheap. It’s not oversized like the model so size up if you want that look!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 23 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"10","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Cloe Thomson","I got this sweatshirt because I wanted a solid oversized one to add to my closet. It is very thick, soft, and warm. This is not one to wear during the summer. I gave it a 4-star because the band at the bottom is not flattering. The sweatshirt is oversized but the band is smaller so it clinches. Another reason I gave it a 4 star is because unless the zipper is all the way unzipped the collar does not lay down. I have short hair so the collar not laying down is uncomfortable so I have had to wear it unzipped. Overall this sweatshirt is good and comfortable. I just want to be honest with the issues I have had so others can decide for them! I wear it still, just won't be buying another one!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"11","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Amazon Customer","As soon as I opened the package I knew I would be returning it- it is very bad quality. The fabric is thin, and there is puffiness around the seams so it doesn’t look like it’s been stitched wellThe fit is also completely off- the arms are puffy, the band at the bottom is tight, but it’s also long, more like a tunic style. It’s just not good at all","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 5 May 2023","4.3 out of 5 stars"

"13","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Dani","I went up a size after reading the reviews, and it was way too big. The material is thin and flimsy. I sent it back. Was so disappointed because of all the great reviews!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 2 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"14","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Dani","WoW! So comfortable, so soft! Very oversized lol I order XL wanting to be sure it’s be oversized enough but I’m sure the L would’ve been fine for me!

"16","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Rmac","I always worry when I buy a sweater it will be too tight. I decided to go with extra large and it’s pretty big. I wish I went with a large. I did decide to keep it however because it’s extremely comfortable just looks baggy and was not the look I was going for. I am 5 foot 2 and about 160-165 for a size reference. Hope this helps another buyer pick the size they are looking for :)","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"19","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Ms Kay","I'm 8 weeks postpartum and I don't fit it my clothes before baby. I was a small before baby, but my current Small sweatshirts are too small. I assumed I'd need a medium, but the medium was way too big, especially the arms. The wrists aren't tight enough to push up and the sleeves are way too long.The fabric is very comfy. If it was a cheap sweatshirt, is keep it with the awkward fit, but not for this price.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 6 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"25","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Vanessa K","This is a great half-zip. It’s comfortable and sooo soft. I am 5’8”, 140 lbs, and wanted something oversized so I sized Up to a medium and it’s a perfect fit. Lots of room and it actually fits my long arms! I can even wrap my hands inside the sleeves if I want. The only complaint I have Is that it isn’t as warm as I was hoping. On cold days I have to layer with a long sleeve underneath. Overall great quality for the discount price I paid..","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"26","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Kindle Customer","Love the feel and color.  Soft.  The fit is weird though.  Oversized but not stretchy on the bottom.  Hits mid hip so doesn't really cover my butt, or roll up well to stay around waist.  But very warm.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 11 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"30","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Indy","Quality is better than other brands sweater. It's a perfect oversize fit. After a few wash it has hold together. I have even wore the sweater for multiple times without washing to see how the sleeves will hold and let me just say they hold . The sleeves elastic bounce back to place without looking stretch out. My only biggest complaint is WHY NO POCKETS??? please use this same design and add pockets. You have others with pocket but you added a hoodie, waist band or its crop. I want an oversize sweater as this one were my mommy body can feel amazing as this sweater makes me feel. If I want to wear something tight with this sweater it covers all my right places.PLEASE consider my suggestion with the pockets. I need them to place my phone and I hate carrying purses/bags.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 5 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"33","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Tori S.","This is a nice, thick pullover sweater. Feels more high end than it is. I agree with other reviews that it leaves a lot of fuzzies on pants, however, this problem cleared up after a couple washes. The wash instructions on my sweatshirt is different than listed here, so that was a bit confusing. I ended up washing on cold and laying flat to dry and I think it shrunk just a little. Runs true to size, somewhat large but not crazy oversized.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 8 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"34","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Luna","So, with the seasons changing, I needed a perfect pullover sweater that is not only comfy and warm but is also professional enough to wear while working from home. This sweater is perfect! It keeps me warm and cozy all day. My only complaint would be that it sheds a little (from the inside) but I imagine the more it’s been worn and washed that this problem would resolve itself. Nonetheless, I definitely recommend this sweater!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"35","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Sass12","I have moved to Idaho where it’s very cold, and I got so sick of ordering the sweatshirts with no fleece pile inside. This is a nice midweight sweatshirt. It runs very wide and long in the arms. I kept it because of the quality. I could’ve tried to size medium. I’m normally a size 10 and I’m wearing a large.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 11 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"36","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Rhonda Ashburn","This is a fun sweatshirt.  It is roomy & warm, but it doesn't have pockets which I miss.

"45","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Linda","I absolutely love this sweater! It’s so cute, great quality and affordable. I always saw the Aritzia one but refused to pay so much for it. This one is a very close dupe to it but for a great price! I’ve washed it several times and the color has stayed in tact, no fading whatsoever. Definitely recommend!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"50","Clothing","Trendy Queen Womens","Jay","Received quickly and less than 48 hrs. This is one of my favorites. 5'3, 170 lbs, & curvy shaped. I would order again. This sweater is extra soft on the inside. It is thick enough to keep warm and loose enough to be able to lounge in, but layering underneath is comfortable if needed. After washing, I did not find any loose threads or bleeding of the material. I like it even more because even though it is over-sized, it compliments me and my body. My sister who is 8 months pregnant loved it so much, that she now wants one of her own. The great thing about it is that it would still fit just as nicely after she has her baby. I would say that this is worthy of giving as a gift. I recommend this sweater.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
