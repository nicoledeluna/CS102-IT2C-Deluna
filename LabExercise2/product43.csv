","phantom","I am very pleased with these Anker Space Q45 headphones. I chose blue and the screen colour is true to the actual colour. They are solid to touch, but very comfortable on my head. The ear muffs cover my ears well. The sound quality out of the box for me was great, but if there were any issues the settings on the App can vary the EQ by genre. The App itself is excellent. Bluetooth paring was immediate. The NC is very good, but there is also a transparency setting which allows some ambient noise - much safer when walking near traffic and pedestrian crossings. The battery life is rated at 50 hours, and the 5 minute charge for another 4 hours is outstanding. I am very pleased.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 14 June 2023","4.4 out of 5 stars"

","William Feng","This will be MY experience with the soundcore Q45, other ears may vary. The q45 tuning out the box did not surprised me at the least. The sounding was a not too great with only a sight emphasis on the bass and the mids sounded not too clear and was distant. The treble sounded great, nice and strong and decently clear. I know you hear everyone say this but honestly once eq, it sounds grwat and definitely worth the price, mids sound clear and bass is strong enough for my liking and also treble is great as ever. The bass up option in my opinion is the most overrated option in this headphone. It does it purpose yes but it ruins every other good aspect of the headphones. For example the clear trebles and the clear mids (when you eq it ) are completely placed in the background and are not great, but if they allowed you to have this type of bass on your custom eq, would be a game changer. The sound leakage is not bad. I haven't noticed anyone hear my sound and being annoyed by it at all. All good. Btw I've seen a review saying they do have sound leakage, completely fault, this review took the headphones off and listened to it from there, that's not how it works. Your head blocks the sound from leaking. Don't trust other reviews I guess ahha. Anc is not as great as premium ones like Bose's, Sony's of course but it does a damn good job. Cuts out low end frequencies well and it does  it purpose. Comfort is a tough choice. With this headphone, it definitely varies cause the headband is quite thin but not thin to the point with people who has decent amount of hair will notice, others will. My experience, nice soft earpads, good headband for me, but the headphones are a little loose so while walking, your music kinda shakes but you'll get used to it. Also you can reduce this through moving it around to get a better fit but it doesn't always get rid of it. Transparency is good. Does it job, does sound tinny but it okay. Does it job. Overall worth it price. I would not go any higher than this brand of headphones. Not worth the upgrade to Sony or bose due to the gap of price. Good headphones soundcore. Also the headphones are a bit bulky looking, if you really care about that, I tbh don't.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 9 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

","phantom","A year on, these are still great headphones I'm getting a lot of use out of. I can't compare them to other noise cancelling devices as I don't have any others, but they definitely make a difference. They'd make even more of one if the headphone clamp was stronger; I have a small head, I suppose, being petite, and there is a noticable improvement in noise reduction if I just press the ear cups with my fingers so they seal better against my head. So I hope that future models can include some sort of adjustment to the band for narrower or wider heads, as it really affects how well the ANC technology gets to show off. But they're JUST tight enough that I can wear them around the place without them shifting on my head, so it's only really the noise isolation affected. They're comfortable for long use, I haven't noticed any of the padding flattening yet, and the sound quality (adjusted to my preferences with the app) is the best of any of my devices. Really enjoyable. Battery life is still great, I listen to music for hours at a time and only have to charge them every few weeks. Quick charge works nicely, and they do work with an audio cable in case the battery dies (no ANC with a flat battery, of course). Not that I've ever actually needed to use that backup. Button control is intuitive, better than my partner's Q35s, although if there is supposed to be an option for skipping tracks with buttons I haven't been able to get that to happen.Last niche comment: Since I have small ears (5cm tall) I've been able to wear these headphones comfortably over new piercings with no issue. Can't say that about on-ear headphones, that's for sure!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 14 June 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

","Raian","Great noise cancelling headsets, especially in this price range. However, there are a few things to be aware of. These are my observations after using the headsets for a while:PROS:- Great sound quality with a lot of preset EQ options in the app- Bluetooth 5.3, connects to two devices at the same time (eg. the phone and the laptop)- Amazing battery life (50hrs with ANC on and 65hrs with ANC off)- Impressive noise cancelling, with the following caveat: the noise cancelling is very good as long as the headsets stay properly sealed around your ears, however, (from my experience) the headsets tend to lose some of the seal when I move my head around, letting some of the noise to come through, which is a little annoying especially on a plane, it is not terrible, but it is noticeableCONS:- Slightly heavier than the top brands like Bose or Sony noise cancelling headsets- Slightly less comfortable than the top brands. On the long-haul flight, you will definitely notice you are wearing them- Probably not the best option for people with very small heads- The transparency mode is good but doesn't reduce the music volume which makes it hard to hear what people are saying if you are listening to a musicBut overall these are great headsets, especially in their price range. If you have never had noise cancelling headsets before you will be very impressed and will enjoy them. However, if you have used the top brands like Bose QC series or Sony XM series before you will notice the difference. Just keep in mind that the Bose or Sony cost twice as much!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 6 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Great for calls during busy commute (good mic setup) Great ergonomics as well.

","PJ","The noise cancellation is expected, I guess it's close to the performance of my AirPods pros but these also have ear cups so that's to be expected, but it also has very long battery life and charges fast. Only issue is that after about 2 days my headphones already start bugging out, and I don't know if it's because the way i fold my headphones into my case but I sometimes get buggy robotic talking sounds every now and then or right on start up. Some weird electric sounding thing. This issue seems to only happen on my computer, but somehow it has fixed itself, it might have to do with a ram issue.Update: I've just had the most creepy experience ever, where I've only ever used this on two devices, yet while it was about late 5am, I was using it on my computer and disconnected it from my phone, then the headphones randomly connected to something unknown and static started playing in my ears.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 19 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

","Lahiru Paranamana","Especially if purchased on sale, these are a fantastic bang for buck in terms of noise cancelling. They were a life saver on a 10 hour plane ride recently.They have all the features you could want in a product like this, except for auto pausing when you take them off. Battery life is phenomenal.While I think these actually have BETTER tuning than the Sony XM4's and Bose QC45's, I still think they sound kinda crap. There are some EQ presets on Poweramp that improve things a bit. The preset on Wavelet is a bit strange. Nothing you do will really fix the treble. Again, I still prefer these to the much more expensive competition.These have plenty of bass on the standard eq setting. I don't know why everyone is saying these lack bass. I guess they are comparing these to the XM4's which have a digustingly high amount of (low quality) bass responce.I definitely found they sound better with noise cancelling and transparency mode off, which is the opposite of what some YouTube reviews said.A little flaw is that they don't really sit flat in the hard case. A bit strange, but it doesn't matter once you zip them up.I also find that they aren't super secure, a problem that is made worse because they are so heavy. They will stay on your head fine when walking around, but might shift around a bit, and if you have noise cancelling on that can create some strange audio artifacts as the ear cups temporarily loose the seal on your head. These really are killer on the plane, bus or train though, in situations where there is a lot of noise but you are sitting still. The looseness adds to the comfort, and the weight means a bigger battery!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 11 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

","Lahiru Paranamana","Just used it on a long international flight and found it a joy to wear.  The noise reduction is good even when directly plugged into the airline headphone socket (with a 2 to 1 adaptor of course).  The headphones have good sensitivity and excellent frequency response across a wide range.  Add the value for money factor and I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I even had to turn off equalization on my iTouch because the built in response was already excellent.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 9 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

","phantom","Like a lot of people who love their music and the affordable earphones that keep coming out I bought these, the ear fun air pro 3 and the Tozo X1.My view might not be like others as everyone has different tastes etc. and I’m not paid for my comment.Firstly I don’t get the people saying these aren’t comfortable or heavy. They are nicer feeling than the XM4, JBL NC can. The padding is great and ear padding are so plush.Surprisingly, the ANC is quite weak. Not as strong as airpod pro first Gen, which in my view anc is on par with earfun 3. Tozo X1 easily the best ANC.Multipoint on X1 and Q45 is seamless between an android and iPhone. Pick up a call on one phone, then take another one on the other phone, hang up and go back to original call - no problem on either. Earfun always sticks on iPhone and I have to tap the speaker icon and choose earfun.What else… well while the anc is weak on Q45, the transparency mode is one the best I have used. Very natural and smooth. Many levels of setting- more impressive than even the XM4. Great stuff.Battery is impressive. Last for too long no issues there. :)The sound. For me, I love the features and making calls and teams meetings - but I just love music sounding good.The sound is quite good out of the box, not as good as the X1 though.. however, the sound test on these is legit. Usually it feels generic, where this one really made a difference and made music sound how it used to 10+ years ago before I had kids.Honestly, once I hit the bass boost option on the Hear Id feature - these are the best sounding headphones I have used.The Tozo X1 is close to these, (and the best earbuds I have used- better sound than the XM4, AirPods Pro, Jabra Elite 7, various Soundpeats, Earfun pro 3,) but these Q45 simply have the best sound in the “normal” market (I don’t own anything above Sony/Bose etc).They are just great at transitions on multipoint, have great transparency and transparency modes, comfortable and great battery - just really poor ANC.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 14 June 2023","4.4 out of 5 stars"

","byrno","As a person with a lot of sensory issues, I have found these to be just what I need! I like the adaptive noise cancelling mode but think it's really great to also be able to customise it too. Whilst it doesn't cancel out all noise, it brings it done right to a level that doesn't have my brain cringing in pain away from it. So for me, that's a huge win! They are also comfortable but as a sensitive person, I can only wear them for short amounts before my ears get really sore (but please note that I am really hypersensitive so this probably won't be an issue for you!) If you ARE a hypersensitive person the wear time has been enough for me to reset my sensory overload button to cope once more with the ""normal"" sounds of life once more. Also, just moving the headphones in different places on the ear, can help increase wearing time for me. You may or not experience this, but I think it's still important to mention, your brain might feel the shift in noise cancellation and cause an airy/lightheaded feeling. That has been an adjustment for me - but please note that I do also have POTS syndrome so I am extremely sensitive to pressure changes. It hasn't triggered any fainting episodes but I don't think it would be wise to wear on a day you are already off-kilter (this is more a point for POTS sufferers).I wasn't really looking at these headphones for sound/music side of things but even so they are good. All over happy with my purchase even though was an expensive purchase.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 2 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

For the price you can’t beat these headphones and I wear them for hours without discomfort. The noise cancelling is excellent and the sound quality is great. They don’t compare to audiophile open back top dollar headphones and do sound better with eq and NQ off but compete with Yamaha, Sony and Bose top tier noise cancellers.

I bought them early for Christmas presents, only to discover they couldn't be returned after November....Noise cancelling headphones we have owned previously have been super quiet for people in the room, but now I am constantly asking the kids to turn down their music, as it sound like white noise from 5 metres away. In my opinion, I shouldn't be able to hear anything.The kids can hear me clearly too, so something has gone amiss.They are also really huge!

The ambient noise cancellation combined with a snug yet comfortable fit makes for total absorption in your choice of audio.

","WD2088","I recently bought a Sony wh XM5 as my main headphone and Soundcore q45 to use as my PC headset. My previous headphones were Bose q35. So I have a quite reasonable idea how top tire  headphones are sounding. To be honest, out of the box, Soundcore sounds crap. But after few research I made some changes to the EQ (Specially turn off bass boost in their signature EQ). I am not a audiophile. But Trust me guys, now sound quality wise I really can't see any difference between Sony and Soundcore. Actually I spent quite a bit of time comparing two headphones with different music genres, but I rarely felt Sony has a edge.  Very happy with the Soundcore. But Sony is more comfortable to wear and sometimes feels like there is more spacy sound.  Soundcore grip around my ears are little bit tight for my liking. I spent a quite bit of time researching best EQ for Soundcore Q45. But with latest firmware update it came adapt EQ settings which automatically set EQ after a sound test. It works marvelously. Finally do I regret buying More expensive Sony (nearly three times expensive)? No. Because I believe that you cry only once when you buy the best. But sound quality and budget wise Soundcore is a serious serious contender.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 November 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I don’t plan on using these outdoors, but even doing things like cooking, these would slip off. Fine for normal office work.ANC works admirably. App for eq settings and customisations is fine. A bit bassy, but this can be adjusted in the app, and they sound good.There is also a feature in the app to adjust the eq based on what you can hear. This works really well, better than presets. Best of all, there are buttons. I hate touch controls on earbuds and headphones.Case and accessories are adequate. But could be a bit nicer.

","Eric Tang","The Q45 are excellent! I'd rate them as good or better than my Sony WH1000XM4 !!Very comfortable, great sound out of the box, if you don't like the settings just set the custom EQ through the app.Editing after close to 6 months of regular use -Value for money and sound is good but the build quality is not that great, after few months of use.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

","R Hamilton","Bought Soundcore Space Q45 ANC Bluetooth headphones mainly for travel but as backups for listening to music on my mobile. They were on special and I went ahead and purchased them given how impressed I was by the Space Q40 IEM earphones from same brand,  which I had recently purchased. Well made and comfortable with easy connectivity and solid audio quality at fair price.  Maybe not up with top Bose or Sony models in terms of sound or noise cancelling but can't argue for the money.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

","Asaad Aladwani","Great buy. Bought it on a deal. I have pretty large ears and it only gets hot after about 2 to 3 hrs. Comfortable. Connectivity is strong. Does occasionally need re-pairing when using on pc and call comes in on phone whilst using multipoint connection. Thankfully it's easy with the app which is simple and intuitive. Battery lasts long. Included audio jack aux cable is short. Recommend buying a third party cable. ANC can be used even with audio jack plugged in. Sound is louder wired compared to wireless. Updates are frequent. Sound quality is excellent. Needs slight tuning for your preference. I use +5, +3, -1, -3, +3, -1, +2, -1/0 for the EQ. Default acoustic is not too bad either. An update made the soundcore signature sound bassup effect more bassy. It was either this or a 2nd hand Sony XM4. Picked this for novelty and warranty. Included case is a tight fit so that's less than ideal. Overall happy purchase. Took about 8 days delivery to Perth.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 27 February 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I compared this with bose before I bought this but this is way beyond expectation and has way better performance than Ive ever expected.

","William Feng","Read lots of reviews for over head ANC headphones. Took a punt, and i have to say these are as good as my bose ANC QC's (which i gave to my wife) the only reason it was 5/5 stars is that the controls were a bit tiny for my fat fingers to use. Otherwise these are brilliant.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 9 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

","Jade Go","These headphones are by no means perfect, but overall it's fantastic.  These are not the sort you could wear for several hours at a stretch.  By the 30min mark they're uncomfortably warm and a little too tight.  But thankfully I only wear them for 1 hour stretches.  Any longer than that I revert to the A40 earbuds (fantastic earbuds I might add).  Sounds are great - just not mind-blowing.  But since I don't listen to much music these headphones are ideal.  It's a shame that with the exceptional battery life I can't wear them outside as they are not built for comfort.  They're also not waterproof - but then again, my other headphones weren't either.  So, great for what I need them for, and they compliment the A40 earbuds.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 30 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

","Andre Estrella","I really wanted to love these as the ANC is excellent and the user interface of the Soundcore app is a breeze. Unfortunately I had a couple of issues with mine. 1) One side did not work in transparency mode. 2) The headset is very,  very large to the point of looking silly and is quite heavy. I don’t have a small head either. They sat too low on my head and I wasn’t able to adjust them any higher.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 10 December 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

","Kindle Customer","I recently purchased this headphone from Amazon, and unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. The headphone is heavy, and the top cushion is not comfortable at all. I can feel the wire inside the cushion on my head, which adds to the discomfort.After using it for a couple of weeks, I still haven't been able to get used to it, and it has been causing me constant headaches and pain in my external ear canal. Although the quality of the headset is decent, the discomfort it causes makes it unpleasant to use.Overall, I am disappointed with this purchase, and I would not recommend this headphone to anyone looking for a comfortable listening experience who can't use it for over an hour.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 23 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

","LamingtonCroissant","Really good sound once you mess with the equaliser in the app a bit. Great noise cancelling and one of the best battery life of any NC headphones on the market. Purely out of preference, I prefer these to the Sony WH-1000XM4 and even if others disagree I think for the price difference the fact these headphones can even compete makes them a no-brainer for best NC headphones under $300.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
